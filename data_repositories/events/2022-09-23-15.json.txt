The logic for lzma1/2 and delta filters will most likely just be simply moved into this new validation function.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/issues/56/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/issues/56/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-09-23T15:08:36Z"}
