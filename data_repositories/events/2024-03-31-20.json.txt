The resolver function appears to trigger this when it is only referenced by the `__attribute__`. Here is an example program that should trigger the warning:\r\n\r\n```C\r\nstatic void resolved(void) {\r\n    return;\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic void (*resolver (void)) (void) {\r\n\treturn resolved;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid indirect_function(void) __attribute__((__ifunc__(\"resolver\")));\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    indirect_function();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nGCC does not issue a warning for the above program. [Here](https://godbolt.org/z/9f1TnjG7h) is a godbolt.org snippet of the above code to allow you to easily test it.
