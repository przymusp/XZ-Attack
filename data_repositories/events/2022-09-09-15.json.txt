The multithreaded encoder uses  lzma_raw_encoder_memusage() to validate the filters, but this allows for LZMA1. Single-threaded uses lzma_block_encoder_init() which disallows LZMA1 because it calls lzma_filter_flags_encode() which is where the problem is caught.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/issues/55/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/issues/55/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-09-09T15:00:24Z"}
