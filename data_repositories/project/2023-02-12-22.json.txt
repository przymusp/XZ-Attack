Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [X] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been reviewed and added / updated if needed (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Build was run locally and without warnings or errors\r\n- [X] All previous and new tests pass\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request type\r\n\r\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type, submit multiple\r\npull requests if needed. --> \r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, renaming, typo fix)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [X] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other (please describe): \r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\r\nNo Windows CI at all.\r\n\r\n<!-- Related issue this PR addresses, if applicable -->\r\nRelated Issue URL: https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/issues/18\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by this\r\nPR. -->\r\n\r\n- autotools build set for Windows added\r\n- build is using msys2 with UCRT64 toolchain\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and\r\nmigration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR. -->\r\nCMake build part is not provided as part of this PR.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes:\r\n* bumped checkout action to v3 (not really critical, but I did while trying to understand build failure)\r\n* fixed \"false positive\" uninitialized warning with empty in stream_encoder.c\r\n* fixed missing include in memcmplen.h, because this include is not provided if --disable-threads is requested for build\r\n\r\nWindows build run is very slow (comparing to others), but I don't think it could be somehow improved.","created_at":"2023-02-12T22:06:00Z","updated_at":"2023-02-12T22:06:00Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/34/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/34/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/34/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/statuses/b104d53c4a03c6b92f4acf5b05d892eb2199c536","head":{"label":"arixmkii:win-ci","ref":"win-ci","sha":"b104d53c4a03c6b92f4acf5b05d892eb2199c536","user":{"login":"arixmkii","id":36887373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODg3Mzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36887373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii","html_url":"https://github.com/arixmkii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":600817918,"node_id":"R_kgDOI8_A_g","name":"xz","full_name":"arixmkii/xz","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arixmkii","id":36887373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODg3Mzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36887373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii","html_url":"https://github.com/arixmkii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arixmkii/xz","description":"XZ

did while trying to understand build failure)\r\n* fixed \"false positive\" uninitialized warning with empty in stream_encoder.c\r\n* fixed missing include in memcmplen.h, because this include is not provided if --disable-threads is requested for build\r\n\r\nWindows build run is very slow (comparing to others), but I don't think it could be somehow improved.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/34/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/34/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1427146946","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/34#issuecomment-1427146946","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/34","id":1427146946,"node_id":"IC_kwDOIQBEvs5VEIjC","user":{"login":"arixmkii","id":36887373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODg3Mzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36887373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii","html_url":"https://github.com/arixmkii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-12T22:17:22Z","updated_at":"2023-02-12T22:17:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This
