Research paper or blog might be a good outcome. This is something @cdolfi & @GaryPWhite have been talking about.\r\n* Sophia's MSR paper might also be relevant for this topic: [Estimating Usage Of Open Source Projects](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-data-science/files/15373707/msr2024-industry-p88.1.pdf)\r\n\r\nFrom Cali on Slack: A discussion in the Augur-8Knot meeting ([@Gary White](https://chaoss-workspace.slack.com/team/U0563UK9ABW)) came up to look at specific metrics around the xz vulnerability (repo is locked in https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz). I wanted to open it up to a broader research idea I had. Originally mine was around codebase signals before a mass exodus of a project. It would be great to organize with whoever is interested to:\r\n- Choose whether we wanted to look at the topic project exodus or malicious code vulnerability  \r\n- pick a few projects that had the cited event happen\r\n- each person look at the tools/metrics they regularly use to see if there are any trends leading up to this event\r\n- See if there are any relevant conclusions from this experiment and create a blog post or otherwise with our findings\n\n### Related Links\n\n_No response_\n\n### How would you like to be involved in this project?\n\nI am interested in this project, but do not plan to work on it myself\n\n### Additional Notes.\n\nI wanted to capture this along with the rest of the projects, but no pressure at all to work on this now. I know that Cali is on vacation / really busy at work, so this is here for whenever people are ready to tackle it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chaoss/wg-data-science/issues/56/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chaoss/wg-data-science/issues/56/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-20T06:53:18Z","org":{"id":29740296,"login":"chaoss","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/chaoss","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29740296?"}}
