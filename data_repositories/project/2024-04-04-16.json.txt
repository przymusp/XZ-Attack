If the vcpkg port was to be upgraded, it will have to pass the continuous integration to get merged into vcpkg master, which means the CI agents will have to be able to download the distfiles, which right now, they can't, so the mirror issue is addressed by the next commit to lzma, or the commit won't get merged.\r\n> \r\n> That's just a workaround for unlucky dudes to put the fire off. I am lucky enough bc there is a fall back version of builtin baseline vcpkg json in my project that does not need to upgrade lzma to this version or above.\r\n> \r\n> I hope some one smarter could figure out how to fix this dependency becuase the mentioned workaround breaks CI/CD totally.\r\n\r\nIf it's just a workaround, rather then a fix, then, for this specific issue, namely `libheif` failing to deploy, the `xz` dependency [originates in the gdk-pixbuf dependency of libheif](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/c5da4bafbd4f47428dea8bdfec96312950dbbf83/ports/libheif/vcpkg.json#L11), which [implies a tiff dependency](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/c5da4bafbd4f47428dea8bdfec96312950dbbf83/ports/gdk-pixbuf/vcpkg.json#L18), which [implies a liblzma dependency](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/ports/tiff/vcpkg.json#L20).\r\n\r\nThe liblzma dependency in tiff is [optional, but enabled by default](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/c5da4bafbd4f47428dea8bdfec96312950dbbf83/ports/tiff/vcpkg.json#L20). You can disable the dependency by asking vcpkg to deploy tiff w/o the lzma feature, either by adding an explicit `tiff` dependency to the top level project (i.e. the OP's project), which asks for `tiff` w/o tiff's default features, and as `gdk-pixbuf` doesn't explicitly require the lzma feature, it'll (hopefully) be usable with a tiff that lacks lzma support, or by manually `vcpkg install`-ing tiff w/o lzma support before `install`-ing libheiff.\r\n\r\nIn manifest mode, replace the `libheif` dependency line by something like\r\n```\r\n   \"libheif\",\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"tiff\",\r\n      \"default-features\": false\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\nIn monolithic mode, instead of `vcpkg install libheif`, use\r\n```\r\nvcpkg install 'tiff[core]' libheif\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/comments/2037698976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-04T16:44:41Z","org":{"id":6154722,"login":"microsoft","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/microsoft","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?"}}
