I have observed that on this platform, with no regard to the date before and after it was acquired by Microsoft, that the _Release_ section, when it contains items In the _Assets_ section, may display a _Source code_-named link, which is the one I referred to and you referred to as well, as downloaded though.\r\n\r\nI have always assumed, nonetheless without foundation, that all of the items that are present in this _Assets_ section provide the project's source code equally, however in various file formats. Hence I kept wondering the motivation for displaying a _Source code_-named link, The present project suits as an illustration.\r\n\r\nWhile focusing on the latest release, among the displayed items those ones are present:\r\n- `<icon> xz-5.4.5.tar.gz      | 2.75 MB | 2 weeks ago`\r\n- `<icon> Source code (tar.gz) |         | 2 weeks ago`\r\n\r\n_Notes:_ \r\n1.
