I would like to know if the patches in vcpkg are still doing what they originally did and if something should be changed upstream.\r\n\r\n1. Is `add_support_ios.patch` good even after the upstream commit [Don't build bundles on Apple OSes](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/21588ca34af98738954fc12ded1b89d7294ef646) from 2020? The patch in vcpkg was added for 5.2.5 and the upstream commit was backported to 5.2.6 and included in 5.4.0. Is the upstream commit wrong and bundles should be enabled? I'm not familiar with building on Apple OSes so I'm relying on information from others.\r\n\r\n2. I guess that `fix_config_include.patch` was a workaround to the bug that was fixed in [Fix building of resource files when config.h isn't used](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/352ba2d69af2136bc814aa1df1a132559d445616) in 2020 and backported to 5.2.6 and included in 5.4.0. In 5.6.2 the directory `windows/vs2019` doesn't even exist anymore as the VS project files have been removed.\r\n\r\n3. I guess that `win_output_name.patch` is an alternative to the upstream fix [Fix the import library filename](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/e67aaf698de75c73443a5ec786781cbf2034461d) that was included in 5.4.5 (and now 5.2.13 too). If the current upstream code isn't correct then it likely should be fixed.\r\n\r\n4. I'm a bit lost here but `vcpkg-cmake-wrapper.cmake` seems to force add `Threads::Threads` dependency for liblzma. With MinGW-w64 it can find pthreads but liblzma on Windows uses native Windows threads by default. `CMakeLists.txt` explicitly avoids `Threads::Threads` in this case so that pthreads library won't get uselessly linked in with MinGW-w64.\r\n\r\n5. `portfile.cmake` installs `liblzma.pc`. However, that was added to upstream `CMakeLists.txt` in [Generate and install liblzma.pc if not using MSVC](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/989c8c354cbd2d20fbae4a432a3e31f5bc1cb9bf) and included in 5.4.5. As the commit says, it's not enabled with Visual Studio. Should it be? `portfile.cmake` handles `debug` in the prefix specially though, and I have no idea if upstream should care about that. In any case, there seems to be some overlap with `liblzma.pc` handling at the moment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/comments/2144974459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-03T11:38:40Z","org":{"id":6154722,"login":"microsoft","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/microsoft","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?"}}
