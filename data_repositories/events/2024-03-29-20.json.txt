Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been reviewed and added / updated if needed (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Build was run locally and without warnings or errors\r\n- [x] All previous and new tests pass\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request type\r\n\r\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type, submit multiple\r\npull requests if needed. --> \r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\r\n\r\nOn LoongArch the generic table-based CRC32 implementation is used.\r\n\r\n<!-- Related issue this PR addresses, if applicable -->\r\nRelated Issue URL: None\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThe crc.w.{b/h/w/d}.w instructions in LoongArch can calculate the CRC32 result for 1/2/4/8 bytes in a single operation, making the use of LoongArch CRC32 instructions much faster compared to the general CRC32 algorithm.\r\n\r\nOptimized CRC32 will be enabled if the kernel declares the LoongArch CRC32 instructions supported via AT_HWCAP.\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and\r\nmigration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR.
