When using Ruby 3.3, users would see a warning if this library is used, which happens when the data-uri attribute is set. The functionality has been replaced with a lower-level method on the String object (String#pack), which the base64 library delegates to anyway.\n\nThis release also sets the cloaked-context attribute on a source block that is defined using either a styled paragraph or a literal or fenced code structural container. This matches the functionality used for custom block extensions (when the source context does not match the final parsed context).\n\n#### Distribution\n\n-   [RubyGem (asciidoctor)](https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor)\n\nAsciidoctor is also packaged for [Fedora](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor), [Debian](https://packages.debian.org/sid/asciidoctor), [Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=asciidoctor), [Alpine Linux](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=asciidoctor), [OpenSUSE](https://software.opensuse.org/package/rubygem-asciidoctor), and [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/asciidoctor). You can use the system's package manager to install the package named **asciidoctor**.\n\n#### Changelog\n\n##### Improvements\n\n-   Set `cloaked-context` attribute on source block when context is not `:listing` ([#&#8203;4556](https://togithub.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues/4556))\n\n##### Compliance\n\n-   Remove use of base64 library to prevent warning in Ruby >= 3.3 ([#&#8203;4561](https://togithub.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues/4561))\n\n#### Release meta\n\nReleased on: 2024-03-08\nReleased by: [@&#8203;mojavelinux](https://togithub.com/mojavelinux)\nRelease beer: Turbo Laser by Resolute Brewing Company\n\nLogs: [resolved issues](https://togithub.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Av2.0.22+is%3Aclosed) | [source diff](https://togithub.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/compare/v2.0.21...v2.0.22) | [gem diff](https://my.diffend.io/gems/asciidoctor/v2.0.21/v2.0.22)\n\n#### Credits\n\nA very special thanks to all the **awesome** [supporters of the Asciidoctor OpenCollective campaign](https://opencollective.com/asciidoctor), who provide critical funding for the ongoing development of this project.\n\n### [`v2.0.21`](https://togithub.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/releases/tag/v2.0.21)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/compare/v2.0.20...v2.0.21)\n\nThis is a patch release in the 2.0.x release line, primarily to address compatibility with Ruby 3.3. While development of Asciidoctor 2.1 is beginning to pick up again, we extracted several other important improvements and bug fixes from main to include in this patch release.\n\nThe most critical fix in this release is to make Asciidoctor's logger compatible with the logger API in Ruby 3.3. The code is now tested against Ruby 3.3 on each change. Nearly as important, this release also turns off Ruby's system-dependent newline conversion when writing files so that Asciidoctor's output is consistent between \\*nix and Windows.\n\nNumerous changes were made to correct AsciiDoc parsing. A nested dlist attached using a list continuation no longer consumes a detached paragraph. And an attached block is correctly attached to a nested dlist when that dlist is offset from its parent by an empty line. The secondary and tertiary terms on the `indexterm` macro are preserved when the primary term is quoted and contains an equals sign. And a bare URL enclosed in angle brackets acts as unconstrained syntax that stops at the first occurrence of a closing angle bracket. When includes are not enabled, any spaces in the include target are preserved when generating the fallback link.\n\nSeveral changes were made to the DocBook output to address compliance. The abstract is moved inside the `<info>` tag (applies to both the abstract in the preamble as well an an abstract for a book part). The `scaledwidth` and `scale` attributes are now supported on an inline macro, like with a block image macro.\n\nA few changes to the manpage output were made. Cells in the head row are styled as bold. Paragraph breaks in a normal table cell are preserved.\n\nFinally, a few refinements to the default stylesheet were applied. The extra border below the doctitle when the sidebar toc is collapsed into main content area was removed. And a text decoration was added to the active footnote number link in the footnotes list.\n\n#### Distribution\n\n-   [RubyGem (asciidoctor)](https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor)\n\nAsciidoctor is also packaged for [Fedora](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor), [Debian](https://packages.debian.org/sid/asciidoctor), [Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=asciidoctor), [Alpine Linux](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=asciidoctor), [OpenSUSE](https://software.opensuse.org/package/rubygem-asciidoctor), and [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/asciidoctor).
