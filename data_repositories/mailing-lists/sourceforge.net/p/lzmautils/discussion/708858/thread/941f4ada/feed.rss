&lt;p&gt;The index info feature hasn't been even in a development release and has seen little testing. Usually I don't add new features into a stable branch to reduce the probability of regressions. Perhaps an exception should be made with index info, I will think about it. The idea of stable and development releases doesn't work when there aren't any releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Lasse Collin</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 06 Mar 2018 20:38:11 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://sourceforge.net4f471462c127a643f3c163669913250dc5b296f9</guid></item><item><title>On Windows MSVC is supported, but doesn't make xz.exe?</title><link>https://sourceforge.net/p/lzmautils/discussion/708858/thread/941f4ada/?limit=25#e889</link><description>&lt;div class="markdown_content"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you specifically need the xz tool, you can use the 7z command line tool to handle .xz files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I'm hoping for a new release soon. One of the PCSX2 (PS2 emulator) developers has code ready to add support for .xz compression of ISO files. However, he wants index info in the .xz files, which hasn't had a full release yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tony Balsley</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2018 16:40:06 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://sourceforge.net4996882880e9efba373461c5278eb984534e5fe8</guid></item><item><title>On Windows MSVC is supported, but doesn't make xz.exe?</title><link>https://sourceforge.net/p/lzmautils/discussion/708858/thread/941f4ada/?limit=25#3474</link><description>&lt;div class="markdown_content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VS project files only support static and shared liblzma. The xz command line tool depends on POSIX features and proper porting hasn't been done yet. Someone had an initial version but it would have required further work, I don't remember the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xzdec doesn't rely on POSIX features so that would be easier to port, but that only does decompression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A possible way to test the speed could be to build xz.exe with MinGW-w64 but link it against shared liblzma.dll. Then you could build liblzma.dll with another compiler and try the resulting DLL with xz.exe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7-Zip supports .xz format. Unless you specifically need the xz tool, you can use the 7z command line tool to handle .xz files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Lasse Collin</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2018 22:38:03 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://sourceforge.net3ee95e764864f6e7265b725245a1fc5e59c616c9</guid></item><item><title>On Windows MSVC is supported, but doesn't make xz.exe?</title><link>https://sourceforge.net/p/lzmautils/discussion/708858/thread/941f4ada/?limit=25#dd08</link><description>&lt;div class="markdown_content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to build xz.exe with VS2017 (actually Intel C++ Compiler for speed), but all I can compile is liblzma.lib and liblzma.dll.   How can I build xz.exe ?  There's no project file for xz, although  it's called xz_win.slm!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tetsuji Rai</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2018 06:17:42 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://sourceforge.net7499339ae9d03a702f8c3caaf542318c51deb994</guid></item></channel></rss>
