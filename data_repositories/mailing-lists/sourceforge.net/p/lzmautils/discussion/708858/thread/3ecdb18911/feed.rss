Wanted to make a whole 64GB (USB3) disk image, and using "xz -0" between to save efficiently empty sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started:&lt;br/&gt;
dd if=/dev/sdb | xz  -0 --compress &amp;gt;/mnt/sdc1/backups/usb64G.img.xz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it has been running 30 minutes, and I read the xz manual page more and noticed --verbose would had been nice to give. But I do not want to break the process now and loose 30 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output file size is now 10G, so I assume it will take about 1 hour still if 50% is roughly a compression level reached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would be nice, if one could send eg. SIGUSR1 to the process, and then if stderr is writable, would start to output the same information which happens if --verbose was chosen in the start.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Yes, I know Clonezilla is a good tool to make whole disk images and so much more, but wasn't available now and didn't want to reboot.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">zimon</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2019 16:56:17 -0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://sourceforge.net1b19645fe775524fdb60c3be9942c2626d2059ae</guid></item></channel></rss>
