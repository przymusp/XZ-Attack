Avoiding the traditional method is\ngood because it breaks LTO (-flto) builds with GCC.\n\nSee also: https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=101766\n\nFor now the only extra symbols in liblzma_linux.map are the\ncompatibility symbols with the patch that spread from RHEL/CentOS 7.\nThese require the use of __symver__ attribute or __asm__(\".symver ...\")\nin the C code. Compatibility with the patch from CentOS 7 doesn't\nseem valuable on MicroBlaze so use liblzma_generic.map on MicroBlaze\ninstead. It doesn't require anything special in the C code and thus\nno LTO issues either.\n\nAn alternative would be to detect support for __symver__\nattribute in configure.ac and CMakeLists.txt and fall back\nto __asm__(\".symver ...\") but then LTO would be silently broken\non MicroBlaze. It sounds likely that MicroBlaze is a special\ncase so let's treat it as a such because that is simpler.
