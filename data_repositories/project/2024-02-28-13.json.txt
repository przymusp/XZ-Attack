Currently, we do not have any official benchmark framework for any of the XZ projects. When we develop new features that require benchmarking data, we tend to collect the files with characteristics that best fit that feature (data type, size, entropy, etc.). Often times community members will also help us benchmark since they may have access to machines, data, or ideas that the maintainers do not.\r\n\r\nAs such, we do not have any plans for a more official, robust, and structured benchmark framework at this time. We unfortunately have a few high priority tasks to attend to first. Eventually, this could be a nice thing to have when we revisit encoder/decoder optimizations to make it easier for the community to help us test various ideas. We would likely maintain a separate repository for this so it could be useful for other .xz implementations.\r\n\r\nIf you have ideas on good ways to do this or bad things we should avoid, we are always open to suggestions :) . We probably wouldn't want to actually host the benchmark data ourselves due to storage requirements and potential file distribution copyright complexities, but a bring-your-own-data framework could be useful for people. Such a thing may already exist, so we would need to start by surveying what solutions other projects use for something like this.
