In fact, FreeBSD have a set of macros called [capsicum_helpers(3)](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=capsicum_helpers&sektion=3) which [wraps](https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/tree/lib/libcapsicum/capsicum_helpers.h#n153) this anti-pattern.\r\n\r\n<!-- Related issue this PR addresses, if applicable -->\r\nRelated Issue URL: https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=269185\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nxz will ignore sandbox failures caused by the kernel lacking support of capsicum mode.\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nThe proposed patch modified `cap_*` calls to also check if the failure was caused by the lack of support (ENOSYS) and make it ignore it.  If possible, it's probably reasonable to just use `caph_*` calls found in `capsicum_helpers(3)`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/43/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/43/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1464305338","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/43#issuecomment-1464305338","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/43","id":1464305338,"node_id":"IC_kwDOIQBEvs5XR4a6","user":{"login":"delphij","id":1045626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDU2MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1045626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij","html_url":"https://github.com/delphij","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-10T19:29:02Z","updated_at":"2023-03-10T19:29:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Larhzu Regarding warning message -- it doesn't matter much as long as the return value is zero.  Personally, I'd prefer not having the warning message, because 1) Capsicum is enabled by default and user has to deliberately disable it with a custom built kernel; we are discussing about remove the option and make it mandatory, but right now for those who disabled it it can be quite annoying to see the message every invocation of xz, and 2) this behavior (no warning when capsicum is not supported) is what everyone else does currently, the preferred (capsicum_helper) wrapper even handled it for the developer.\r\n\r\nI've updated the manual page for other `cap_*` system calls for FreeBSD in https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src/commit/75798f9b01055261881938326a5c77e55f79c7f7 to reflect the fact that they do return `ENOSYS`.\r\n\r\n(Maybe we should close this PR and move the discussion somewhere else? :) )","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1464305338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-10T19:29:02Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
