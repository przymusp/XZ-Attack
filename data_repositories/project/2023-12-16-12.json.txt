This seems to\nhave been forgotten since these function pointers were added many years\nafter the original two (code() and end()).\n\nThe problem is that by not setting this to NULL we are relying on the\nmemory allocation to zero things out if lzma_filters_update() is called\non a LZMA1 encoder. The function pointer for set_out_limit() is less\nserious because there is not an API function that could call this in an\nincorrect way. set_out_limit() is only called by the MicroLZMA encoder,\nwhich must use LZMA1 where set_out_limit() is always set. Its currently\nnot possible to call set_out_limit() on an LZMA2 encoder at this time.\n\nSo calling lzma_filters_update() on an LZMA1 encoder had undefined\nbehavior since its possible that memory could be manipulated so the\noptions_update member pointed to a different instruction sequence.\n\nThis is unlikely to be a bug in an existing application since it relies\non calling lzma_filters_update() on an LZMA1 encoder in the first place.\nFor instance, it does not affect xz because lzma_filters_update() can\nonly be used when encoding to the .xz format.\n\nThis is fixed by using memzero() to set all members of lzma_lz_encoder\nto NULL after it is allocated. This ensures this mistake will not occur\nhere in the future if any additional function pointers are added.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/commits/183a62f0b540ff4d23cc19b2b6bc2525f0bd64df"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-16T12:54:34Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
