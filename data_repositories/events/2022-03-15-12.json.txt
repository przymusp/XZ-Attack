The issue\nwith truncated xz files was the main threaded had a race condition with the\nlast worker thread. The main thread was telling the worker thread to do\npartial updates after the worker thread had already begun sleeping until more\ninput arrived. The main thread then went to sleep until the worker thread\nfinished its input. This resulted in deadlock since both threads are sleeping\nand waiting on the other to wake it","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/commits/5f020915b4e9b60759515df61b9812c1d45c8995"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-03-15T12:28:39Z"}
