So I'll just omit that exception then. There (hopefully) should be no need to complicate it with options. I have [committed this](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/afa938e429c1ce07d26d02999352fb014b62ff3d) now.\r\n\r\nI don't know if Autotools + MSVC works in XZ Utils; it's possible that something tiny is lacking at the XZ Utils side. I don't remember if anyone has ever tested it. CMake support was added initially to get rid of VS project files. Only later CMake support was expanded to non-MSVC use cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n`THREADS_PREFER_PTHREAD_FLAG TRUE` is not about Windows. It's about how pthread support is detected. Leaving it `FALSE` is legacy; it should always be `TRUE` so that `-pthread` is checked before `-lpthread` and such linker flags. In any case `find_package(Threads REQUIRED)` will find both threading methods with MinGW-w64, setting these:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCMAKE_USE_WIN32_THREADS_INIT=1\r\nCMAKE_USE_PTHREADS_INIT=1\r\nThreads_FOUND=TRUE\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, Windows needs nothing to enable threading support, thus `Thread::Threads` does nothing useful **if** one knows that pthreads won't be used anyway. But I see now that it might not hurt either if no pthread functions are called as the linker may omit the `libwinpthread-1.dll` dependency then. There might be fine details that I don't understand well enough right now. Maybe the forcing of `Threads::Threads` dependency matters if using CMake's own FindLibLZMA module and linking against static liblzma that uses pthreads (not Windows threads).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/comments/2145520684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-03T15:31:51Z","org":{"id":6154722,"login":"microsoft","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/microsoft","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?"}}
