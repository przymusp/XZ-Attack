The first replaces the crc64 construct with the ifunc resolver.\r\n2. The second modifies the build process to account for the ifunc attribute.\r\n\r\nHAVE_FUNC_ATTRIBUTE_IFUNC is set if ifuncs can be built\r\non the system. glibc has supported ifunc since version 2.11 (2009). Building for older machines\r\nmay want to manually disable ifunc support when building.\r\n--disable-ifunc can be used with autotools and\r\nUSE_ATTR_IFUNC=OFF can be used with CMake to disable the check for ifunc support.\r\nUSE_ATTR_IFUNC defaults to ON for CMake and enable_ifunc defaults to yes for autotools.\r\n\r\nMore about ifuncs can be read [here](https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/GNU_IFUNC) or [here](https://www.agner.org/optimize/optimizing_cpp.pdf#page=142).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been reviewed and added / updated if needed (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Build was run locally and without warnings or errors\r\n- [X] All previous and new tests pass\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request type\r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, renaming, typo fix)\r\n- [X] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [X] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other (please describe): \r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\ncrc64\\_fast currently uses the \\_\\_attribute\\_\\_ constructor to choose the crc implementation to use.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nI replaced the \\_\\_attribute\\_\\_((\\_\\_constructor\\_\\_)) with \\_\\_attribute\\_\\_((ifunc())) in crc64_fast.c\r\n\r\n- The HAVE_FUNC_ATTRIBUTE_IFUNC flag was added to configure.ac\r\n- The USE_ATTR_IFUNC cmake option was added to CMakeLists.txt\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\nFunctionality should be identical.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR.
