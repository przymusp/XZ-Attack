proxy, please check your proxy setting. Possible causes are:\r\n      \r\n      1. You are actually using an HTTP proxy, but setting HTTPS_PROXY variable\r\n         to `https://address:port`. This is not correct, because `https://` prefix\r\n         claims the proxy is an HTTPS proxy, while your proxy (v2ray, shadowsocksr\r\n         , etc..) is an HTTP proxy. Try setting `http://address:port` to both\r\n         HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY instead.\r\n      \r\n      2. If you are using Windows, vcpkg will automatically use your Windows IE Proxy Settings\r\n         set by your proxy software. See https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/77\r\n         The value set by your proxy might be wrong, or have same `https://` prefix issue.\r\n      \r\n      3. Your proxy's remote server is out of service.\r\n      \r\n      If you've tried directly download the link, and believe this is not a temporary\r\n      download server failure, please submit an issue at https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/issues\r\n      to report this upstream download server failure.\r\n      \r\n\r\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\r\n  scripts/cmake/vcpkg_download_distfile.cmake:270 (z_vcpkg_download_distfile_show_proxy_and_fail)\r\n  scripts/cmake/vcpkg_from_github.cmake:106 (vcpkg_download_distfile)\r\n  ports/liblzma/portfile.cmake:1 (vcpkg_from_github)\r\n  scripts/ports.cmake:175 (include)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/37919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/37919/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/comments/2031878773","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/37919#issuecomment-2031878773","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/37919","id":2031878773,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBBJcqc55HAJ1","user":{"login":"DeveloperPaul123","id":6591180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTExODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6591180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeveloperPaul123","html_url":"https://github.com/DeveloperPaul123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeveloperPaul123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeveloperPaul123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeveloperPaul123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeveloperPaul123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeveloperPaul123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeveloperPaul123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeveloperPaul123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeveloperPaul123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeveloperPaul123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-02T12:12:14Z","updated_at":"2024-04-02T12:12:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like the xz repo was taken offline by Github? https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/comments/2031878773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-02T12:12:16Z","org":{"id":6154722,"login":"microsoft","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/microsoft","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?"}}
