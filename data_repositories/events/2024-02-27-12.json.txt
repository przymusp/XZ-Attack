You will not be missing out on the sandbox feature unnecessarily because unfortunately your system cannot support this feature until your system call definitions include `SYS_landlock_create_ruleset` and `SYS_landlock_restrict_self`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1966432482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-27T12:24:36Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
