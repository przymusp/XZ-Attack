Would it be possible to release this as a both a new minor release if you decide to do so, but _also_ as a patch release (e.g. `5.6.2`)?. Some projects auto-update dependency patch versions but do so less frequently for bigger version bumps. This would allow this to happen, if it isn't extra work (of course the security advisory _should_ override any such policy and any project _should_ update to the newest version regardless, but ... )\r\n\r\nWe'll discuss this, but no promises.
