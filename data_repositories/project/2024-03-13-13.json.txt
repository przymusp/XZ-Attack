compiler has several issues that make it impossible to build liblzma:\r\n  - the compiler cannot handle unions that contain pointers that are not the first members (in some cases);\r\n  - the compiler cannot handle the assembler code in range_decoder.h (LZMA_RANGE_DECODER_CONFIG has to be set to zero);\r\n  - the compiler fails to produce valid code for delta_decode if the vectorization is enabled, which results in failed tests.\r\n\r\nThis introduces NVHPC-specific workarounds that address the issues.\r\n\r\n## Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been reviewed and added / updated if needed (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Build was run locally and without warnings or errors\r\n- [x] All previous and new tests pass\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request type\r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, renaming, typo fix)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [x] Other (please describe): workarounds for the compiler\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\nIt's not possible to build and get the tests pass with any existing release of the NVHPC compiler even when configuring as follows:\r\n```console\r\n$ ./configure --disable-symbol-versions CPPFLAGS='-DLZMA_RANGE_DECODER_CONFIG=0' CFLAGS='-O'\r\n```\r\n(`-O` is the same as the default `-O2` but without SIMD)\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nIt is possible to build and get the tests pass with any existing release of the NVHPC compiler when configuring as follows:\r\n```console\r\n$ ./configure --disable-symbol-versions\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nI don't know if there is any interest in supporting NVHPC and I'd understand if there's none.","created_at":"2024-03-13T13:06:26Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T13:06:26Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/91/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/91/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/91/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/statuses/44fe303a5395315819dc1e6ba782b7aa6cf75583","head":{"label":"skosukhin:nvhpc-workarounds","ref":"nvhpc-workarounds","sha":"44fe303a5395315819dc1e6ba782b7aa6cf75583","user":{"login":"skosukhin","id":19591868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTkxODY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19591868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skosukhin","html_url":"https://github.com/skosukhin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skosukhin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skosukhin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skosukhin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skosukhin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skosukhin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skosukhin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skosukhin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skosukhin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skosukhin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":771416221,"node_id":"R_kgDOLfrgnQ","name":"xz","full_name":"skosukhin/xz","private":false,"owner":{"login":"skosukhin","id":19591868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTkxODY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19591868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skosukhin","html_url":"https://github.com/skosukhin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skosukhin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skosukhin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skosukhin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skosukhin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skosukhin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skosukhin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skosukhin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skosukhin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skosukhin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/skosukhin/xz","description":"XZ
