On EBCDIC systems the source files are mass-converted from ASCII to EBCDIC before compilation and thus the characters map to different byte values. I think it's enough to check for trailing garbage string and that can be done by comparing CRC32 value, that is, compare the length of the garbage and use lzma_crc32() and compare against known hardcoded value (no need for a #define for the hardcoded value). It's ugly but then it's portable and there's no need for a ASCII string in hex representation.","created_at":"2022-12-15T15:23:21Z","updated_at":"2022-12-15T15:23:21Z","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/1#discussion_r1049775373","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/1","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/comments/1049775373"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/1#discussion_r1049775373"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/1"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/comments/1049775373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":29,"original_line":29,"side":"RIGHT"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/1","id":1165553816,"node_id":"PR_kwDOIQBEvs5FePCY","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/1","diff_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/1.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/1.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/1","number":1,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Tests:
