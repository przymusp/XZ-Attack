type\r\n\r\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type, submit multiple\r\npull requests if needed. --> \r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\r\n\r\nOn LoongArch the generic table-based CRC32 implementation is used.\r\n\r\n<!-- Related issue this PR addresses, if applicable -->\r\nRelated Issue URL: None\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThe crc.w.{b/h/w/d}.w instructions in LoongArch can calculate the CRC32 result for 1/2/4/8 bytes in a single operation, making the use of LoongArch CRC32 instructions much faster compared to the general CRC32 algorithm.\r\n\r\nOptimized CRC32 will be enabled if the kernel declares the LoongArch CRC32 instructions supported via AT_HWCAP.\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking

While the intention behind these changes may have been to improve error reporting, there are concerns about potential security implications, especially in light of the recent discovery of a backdoor in the xz utility.\r\n\r\nUpon reviewing the changes, it appears that safe fprintf calls were replaced with unsafe fprintf calls in the error handling code. This alteration raises concerns about the possibility of introducing vulnerabilities, particularly if terminal escape sequences or other forms of exploitation are inadvertently included in error messages.\r\n\r\nGiven the sensitivity of the situation and the potential for similar vulnerabilities, I believe it's crucial for the project maintainers to thoroughly assess these changes and ensure that they do not inadvertently introduce security risks. Additionally, considering the recent backdoor discovery, it's important to prioritize the security and integrity of the xz utility.\r\n\r\nProposed Actions:\r\n\r\n    Revert the changes made to the error handling code, restoring the use of safe fprintf calls.\r\n    Use archive_errno instead of errno for error handling to mitigate potential risks associated with including terminal escape sequences in error messages.\r\n    Conduct a thorough review of the codebase to identify and address any other potential security concerns.\r\n\r\nAdditional Context:\r\n\r\n    Link to the relevant MR or commit where the changes were made.\r\n    Reference to any discussions or concerns raised by other contributors or community members.\r\n    Any other relevant information or insights that could aid in understanding the issue and its implications.\r\n\r\nRequest for Response:\r\nI kindly request a response from the project maintainers regarding these security concerns and proposed actions. Transparency and collaboration are essential in addressing potential security vulnerabilities and ensuring the continued trust and reliability of the xz utility.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\n### Version\n\n5.6.0/5.6.1\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/94/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":2,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/94/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2027738231","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/issues/94#issuecomment-2027738231","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/94","id":2027738231,"node_id":"IC_kwDOIQBEvs543NR3","user":{"login":"quat1024","id":2068021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjgwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2068021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quat1024","html_url":"https://github.com/quat1024","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quat1024/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quat1024/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quat1024/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quat1024/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quat1024/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quat1024/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quat1024/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quat1024/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quat1024/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-29T21:07:22Z","updated_at":"2024-03-29T21:07:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> in the xz utility's libarchive project (reference to the specific MR or commit)\r\n\r\n> Additional Context: Link to the relevant MR or commit where the changes were made.\r\n\r\n[chatgpt](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/01/02/the-i-in-llm-stands-for-intelligence/)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2027738231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-29T21:07:24Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}

an implementation for crc32 that makes use of clmul.\r\nCode for this implementation was written by Ilya Kurdyukov and can be found here.\r\nhttps://github.com/ilyakurdyukov/crc-clmul-sim\r\n\r\nAlso refactored crc64_clmul to use the new macros created for crc32_clmul.\r\nAs well as moved similar functions to crc_clmul_common to eliminate duplicate code.\r\n\r\nI tested this on files doubling in size starting from 1 byte up to 1 Gigabyte.\r\nDuring testing I found that crc32_clmul can run up to 70% faster than crc32_generic,\r\nand has an average speed increase of 58.4% for sizes greater than 16 bytes.\r\n\r\nI also used this to test the reworked version of crc64_clmul.\r\nThis version of crc64_clmul is an average of 3.9% faster than the original implementation.\r\nThis speed increase is due to some inline assembly as well as changing around the order of some if statements. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [

If there is evidence of the latter I suggest getting it out there post-haste.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/92/reactions","total_count":107,"+1":80,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":8,"rocket":6,"eyes":13},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/92/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2027750326","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/issues/92#issuecomment-2027750326","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/92","id":2027750326,"node_id":"IC_kwDOIQBEvs543QO2","user":{"login":"broukema","id":24659560,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjU5NTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24659560?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/broukema","html_url":"https://github.com/broukema","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/broukema/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/broukema/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/broukema/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/broukema/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/broukema/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/broukema/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/broukema/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/broukema/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/broukema/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-29T21:24:19Z","updated_at":"2024-03-29T21:24:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"There is a live FAQ on this issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/thesamesam/223949d5a074ebc3dce9ee78baad9e27\r\n\r\nAnd to quote from the current version of the `People` part:\r\n\r\n````\r\nPeople\r\n\r\nWe do not want to speculate on the people behind this project in this document.\r\nThis is not a productive use of our time, and law enforcement will be able to handle identifying those responsible.\r\nThey are likely patching their systems too.\r\n\r\nxz-utils has two maintainers:\r\n\r\n    Lasse Collin (Larzhu) who has maintained xz since the beginning (~2009), and before that, lzma-utils.\r\n    Jia Tan (JiaT75) who started contributing to xz in the last 2-2.5 years and gained commit access,\r\n    and then release manager rights, about 1.5 years ago.\r\n\r\nLasse regularly has internet breaks and is on one at the moment, started before this all kicked off.\r\nWe believe CISA may be trying to get in contact with him.\r\n````","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2027750326/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-29T21:24:20Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}

This whole project needs an audit from a reasonably-trusted 3rd-party.\r\n\r\n@github This repo in distributing malware, it should probably be frozen until a full investigation is performed.\r\n\r\nI tried to look into Jia Tan some, but I couldn't find *any* information about them as a person.  Their first commit to xz was early 2022 with https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/6468f7e41a8e9c611e4ba8d34e2175c5dacdbeb4.  What's weird is that it was a direct commit, not a PR or such, though it does say that it was authored by @JiaT75 but committed by @Larhzu.  In fact, all commits are like this up until https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/8ace358d65059152d9a1f43f4770170d29d35754, which is authored and committed by @JiaT75 via https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/2.\r\n\r\nMy first thought based on the name was the CCP sticking their hands in things they shouldn't, but given that I couldn't find *any* info on them as a person, now I'm just left with more questions.  Is Jia Tan even a real person?  Was this a long-play by some state actor?  If so, who?  Or was this just one person going rouge with no connections to groups or states, but if that's the case, then why did they do this?  Was this always the goal, or did something change?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/comments/140386085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-29T21:53:03Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}

But the cat is out of the bag now and I see comments all over the place pinging the author. I think it's high time a bug report *here* notifies people following this tracker there is an issue.

an implementation for crc32 that makes use of clmul.\r\nCode for this implementation was written by Ilya Kurdyukov and can be found here.\r\nhttps://github.com/ilyakurdyukov/crc-clmul-sim\r\n\r\nAlso refactored crc64_clmul to use the new macros created for crc32_clmul.\r\nAs well as moved similar functions to crc_clmul_common to eliminate duplicate code.\r\n\r\nI tested this on files doubling in size starting from 1 byte up to 1 Gigabyte.\r\nDuring testing I found that crc32_clmul can run up to 70% faster than crc32_generic,\r\nand has an average speed increase of 58.4% for sizes greater than 16 bytes.\r\n\r\nI also used this to test the reworked version of crc64_clmul.\r\nThis version of crc64_clmul is an average of 3.9% faster than the original implementation.\r\nThis speed increase is due to some inline assembly as well as changing around the order of some if statements. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [

--> \r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [X] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, renaming, typo fix)\r\n- [X] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other (please describe): \r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\ncrc32\\_fast currently only uses a generic implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nI added an implementation for crc32 that makes use of clmul in crc32_fast.c \r\nAlso refactored crc64_clmul implementation to use the same macros as crc32_clmul\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nHere is the output from both tests that gave me the statistics above.\r\n\r\nthe number of unique files tested on and the number of times the crc is run\r\ndecrease as the bytes get larger so the benchmark does not take too long.\r\n\r\nThe 64 and 32 spd+ show the percentage speed increase over the generic.\r\nThe percentage on the graph show the combined average for all types.\r\nFor example (50% is twice as fast, 200% is twice as slow)\r\n```\r\n64 generic: #\t\t64 clmul: +\r\n32 generic: =\t\t32 clmul: *\r\n\r\n#bytes, #files,   #crc's,  64spd+,  32spd+: 0%          50%          100%        150%         200%\r\n
