For this to be possible, I'd need that the tests executables and scripts be copied (or installed) to a given directory, which I could have set up as a shared folder with a virtual machine.\r\n\r\nThe current behaviour when you cross-compile and issue a `make check`, is that all test programs are built, but then they are executed (which obviously fails, as you are cross compiling).\r\n\r\nIf your build system was plain Makefiles, I'd happily volunteer to implement this feature, but I have no Autotools knowledge, so I'm afraid I cannot help writing it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a good way of implementing this would be to add a switch to configure, so that when that switch is present, all the test programs are built but not executed, and are also installed when you do a `make install`. The only problem I see is that I'm not sure if the main script that runs all tests could be saved as a normal script file or if you are running all the tests directly from the Makefile generated by `configure`.\n\n### Expected Complications\n\n_No response_\n\n### Will I try to implement this new feature?\n\nNo","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/54/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/54/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1613527488","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/issues/54#issuecomment-1613527488","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/54","id":1613527488,"node_id":"IC_kwDOIQBEvs5gLHnA","user":{"login":"thesamesam","id":11667869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjY3ODY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11667869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesamesam","html_url":"https://github.com/thesamesam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesamesam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesamesam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesamesam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesamesam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesamesam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesamesam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesamesam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesamesam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesamesam/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-29T16:53:09Z","updated_at":"2023-06-29T16:53:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Please see the discussion in https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/52.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1613527488/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-06-29T16:53:10Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
