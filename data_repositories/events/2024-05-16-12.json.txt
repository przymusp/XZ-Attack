When I added the check, I felt it was the simplest way to ensure that the code will keep working on odd platforms. [Gnulib's mbrtowc](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/manual/html_node/mbrtowc.html) lists _old versions_ of Minix 3 and HP-UX and also IRIX as lacking `mbrtowc`. I don't think those matter in Meson build at all. The latest MINIX 3 does have `mbrtowc` and so does HP-UX. IRIX is too old.\r\n\r\nSo it's possible that, among the supported or potentially-supported platforms, only DJGPP lacks `mbrtowc`. If so, it could be handled with a special `#ifdef` for that in the C code. But it's also not much work to check it in the build system.\r\n\r\nI currently believe it's fine if the Meson build unconditionally defines `HAVE_MBRTOWC`. It might be cleaned up later along with `HAVE_STDINT_H` and such.","created_at":"2024-05-16T12:02:31Z","updated_at":"2024-05-16T12:02:31Z","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/120#discussion_r1603214275","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/120","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/comments/1603214275"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/120#discussion_r1603214275"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/120"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/comments/1603214275/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":231,"original_line":231,"side":"RIGHT","original_position":231,"position":231,"subject_type":"line"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/120","id":1850635793,"node_id":"PR_kwDOIQBEvs5uTnYR","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/120","diff_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/120.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/120.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/120","number":120,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"WIP:

The actual C code won't use that `#define`, and thus the test and the C code wouldn't be in sync. If you added this because the wcwidth(3) man page in the man-pages package lists it, note that the same line on the man page tells to look at feature_test_macros(7) which tells that `_GNU_SOURCE` already covers this.\r\n\r\nThe codebase relies on some platform-specific extensions when they are available, thus it's not practical to build it with something like `-D_XOPEN_SOURCE=600`. Instead, all system-specific extensions are hoped to be available which means using, for example, `#define _GNU_SOURCE 1`. Also, some of the now-POSIX features were available on some systems before they were standardized in POSIX, so this approach works better on such systems.\r\n\r\nThus, it's essential that `_GNU_SOURCE` and such things are added to project-wide defines before running any checks for available functions or other features, and the checks then don't use any function-specific extra args unless the C code uses such extras too.","created_at":"2024-05-16T12:27:52Z","updated_at":"2024-05-16T12:27:53Z","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/120#discussion_r1603247221","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/120","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/comments/1603247221"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/120#discussion_r1603247221"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/120"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/comments/1603247221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":244,"original_line":244,"side":"RIGHT","original_position":244,"position":244,"subject_type":"line"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/120","id":1850635793,"node_id":"PR_kwDOIQBEvs5uTnYR","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/120","diff_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/120.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/120.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/120","number":120,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"WIP:
