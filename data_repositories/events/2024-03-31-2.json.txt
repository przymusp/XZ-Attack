In context of JiaT75’s other work, I can see those changes introducing the following types of vulnerabilities:\r\n\r\n**Removal of length-at-end**\r\n(1) Without the end-of-data marker, the algorithm (which could also be user specified) could struggle to identify the true end (eg, the user-specified algorithm lacks a clear marker). This could lead to a number of issues with data integrity or unexpected behavior, such as memory leaks, overflows, execution of malicious code, etc. \r\n\r\n**Via a user-specified algorithm** \r\n(2) Code Injection \r\nA threat actor could specify an algorithm that allows custom code execution or manipulation of data structures. \r\n\r\n(3) Weaknesses in other compression algorithms. \r\n_See the Zip64 section, below, as an example._ \r\n\r\n(4) Data corruption\r\nThe specified algorithm may cause bugs that render the data unreadable. \r\n\r\n(5) DoS \r\nThe specified algorithm could be computationally expensive and/or have bugs that consume an excessive amount of resources. \r\n\r\n**via Zip64**\r\n(6) While I have no direct evidence, given JiaT75’s skill level, I’m concerned there may be an unknown vulnerability present in Zip64 itself and/or via an interaction between Zip64 and libarchive (eg, an odd string passed through the user-specified command or in the compressed data). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Lastly, thanks for all you’re doing to review JiaT75’s changes and maintain this code base overall. I know you’re doing this voluntarily and really appreciate the great care you have in keeping people safe.**","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libarchive/libarchive/issues/comments/2028536578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-31T02:57:45Z","org":{"id":1354741,"login":"libarchive","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/libarchive","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1354741?"}}
