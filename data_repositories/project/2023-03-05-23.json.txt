In fact, FreeBSD have a set of macros called [capsicum_helpers(3)](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=capsicum_helpers&sektion=3) which [wraps](https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/tree/lib/libcapsicum/capsicum_helpers.h#n153) this anti-pattern.\r\n\r\n<!-- Related issue this PR addresses, if applicable -->\r\nRelated Issue URL: https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=269185\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nxz will ignore sandbox failures caused by the kernel lacking support of capsicum mode.\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nThe proposed patch modified `cap_*` calls to also check if the failure was caused by the lack of support (ENOSYS) and make it ignore it.  If possible, it's probably reasonable to just use `caph_*` calls found in `capsicum_helpers(3)`.","created_at":"2023-03-05T23:55:38Z","updated_at":"2023-03-05T23:55:38Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/43/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/43/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/43/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/statuses/4388d4f845114c1027b65d985332edaf0a86052d","head":{"label":"delphij:master","ref":"master","sha":"4388d4f845114c1027b65d985332edaf0a86052d","user":{"login":"delphij","id":1045626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDU2MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1045626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij","html_url":"https://github.com/delphij","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":610026927,"node_id":"R_kgDOJFxFrw","name":"xz","full_name":"delphij/xz","private":false,"owner":{"login":"delphij","id":1045626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDU2MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1045626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij","html_url":"https://github.com/delphij","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delphij/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/delphij/xz","description":"XZ
