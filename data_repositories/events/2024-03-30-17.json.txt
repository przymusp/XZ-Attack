have some examples of exploits against busybox and OpenBSD tar in https://dgl.cx/2023/09/ansi-terminal-security#vulnerabilities-using-known-replies I suspect those could apply nearly unmodified here.\r\n\r\nAn attacker can do far more than just print a message, particularly if they are aware of which terminal software the victim is using. I feel like this is CVE worthy and while it shouldn’t matter for a CVE technically, even more so due to the circumstances.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libarchive/libarchive/issues/comments/2028388707/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-30T17:59:13Z","org":{"id":1354741,"login":"libarchive","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/libarchive","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1354741?"}}
