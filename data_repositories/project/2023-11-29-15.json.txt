thanks a lot for the swift review! I will start implementing the suggested changes asap. I am going to focus on fixing the highlighted issues before implementing any new fuzzers, if that makes sense :) \r\n\r\nTo address some of your comments above:\r\n- The new fuzz targets were chosen to cover most of the `liblzma` common use cases from the code of XZ utils (i.e. we expanded the tests to cover the decoders and encoders used by the CLI utilities) \r\n- I completely agree that the fuzz targets' code can be reduced via templates and shared code. Would you like to simply move the common functionality into a separate header file, or to generate the fuzzers' code dynamically by replacing the lines in a template file as well? \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1832193611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-11-29T15:59:46Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
