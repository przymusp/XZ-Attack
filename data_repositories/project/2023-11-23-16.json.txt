we could extract the triple on gcc/clang via `-dumpmachine`\r\n\r\nI don't think this will work for us since a tool like `musl-gcc` (a GCC wrapper for using musl libc) still outputs `x86_64-linux-gnu` with `-dumpmachine`. So this would fix things for Alpine, but our builds would still be broken for anyone compiling for musl libc using a wrapper like this.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1824666098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-11-23T16:05:14Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
