So there is no need for incremental releases, just build it from the source (this is what arch has done for example). The issue is that there might be more things that we are not aware of, since the attack was in preparation for years, so xz team is just trying to be extra cautious (which is the right call imo), and they are trying to remove as much (not just jia stuff, but everything that seems unnecessary), before releasing something that they feel comparable with.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2053598237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-13T10:05:23Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
