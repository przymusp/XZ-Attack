You *must* sell something, you cannot in any way ask people to give yourself or any other entity money without them receiving anything in return. When it comes to what is considered selling, that is where my certainty comes to an end. Extrapolating from [the statement from the police quoted by Mikaela](https://github.com/Mikaela/.github/issues/2#issuecomment-1097905236), a product that is made available equally to those who haven't paid does not constitute valid compensation. Whether for example selling pre-built binaries is good enough is beyond me. I'd imagine that's a service that counts as compensation (as long as you don't also give binaries for free), but, again, IANAL.\r\n\r\nWhat I've seen others mention, however, is that you can certainly sell consultation. That is, support, feature development, what not. Sell it as a service. Dual license, though that may be difficult in case you're developing an existing project with contributions from many people.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2019/20190863#Pidm46111190761008\r\n[2]: https://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2019/en20190863_20191359.pdf","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2152067118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-06T11:12:26Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
