all,\r\n\r\nI have received a lot of attacks from people in public and private.\r\n\r\nI have contacted @Larhzu about this bad situation against me and he has understood.\r\n\r\nIt is important to me to inform people again, I have no link with the backdoor author.\r\n\r\nI only publish announcements of XZ (not only, look next links) and/or I request new release builds in several projects and/or I request software updates in several projects.\r\n\r\nRecently (2024-03-06), I have requested the XZ update to 5.4.5 and 5.6.0 in Microsoft VCPKG project instead 5.4.4, badly no people know that there was a backdoor into 5.6.x branch at this moment.\r\nMaybe it permits to Andres Freund, a Microsoft developer, to discover the backdoor.\r\n\r\nI propose to have a 5.8.x branch without a backdoor.\r\nOdd number can be an unstable branch or a development branch:\r\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Odd-numbered_versions_for_development_releases\r\n\r\nLinked to:\r\n-

at this time, the Avahi project is always UNSECURE because there is no new release build version since 0.8.0 (2020) and a lot of CVEs from 2021 and 2023 have not been fixed. I have requested at several times (and not only me), a new release build etc.\r\n- https://github.com/avahi/avahi/issues/325\r\n- https://github.com/avahi/avahi/issues/430\r\n- https://github.com/avahi/avahi/issues/503\r\n\r\nAnother one, there is a problem into the mRemoteNG project, several CVEs have not been solved too:\r\n- https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/1765\r\n\r\nIn more, there are several dormant/dead projects too that I have tried to wake up with other guys.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2059048097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-16T13:05:59Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
