I need a native rust implementation of lzma decompression for use in [OpenFA](https://openfa.org), so that I can port it to run on the web.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\n\r\nThis pull request was tested by...\r\n\r\n- [x] Added relevant end-to-end tests (an `.xz` file with a delta filter).\r\n- [x] Integrated into OpenFA's GeoTiff parser and demonstrated equivalent function to liblzma. \r\n- [x] Ran `cargo bench` to verify there were no performance regressions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Supporting Documentation and References\r\n\r\nCode for the delta filter was adapted from the C code in [xz-file-format.txt](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/blob/master/doc/xz-file-format.txt).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-02T02:45:23Z","updated_at":"2023-11-11T14:38:37Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fdaa94b952315b8739e32f78782a681f504619a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2037996122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM3OTk2MTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gendx/lzma-rs/labels/waiting%20on%20author","name":"waiting

I need a native rust implementation of lzma decompression for use in [OpenFA](https://openfa.org), so that I can port it to run on the web.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\n\r\nThis pull request was tested by...\r\n\r\n- [x] Added relevant end-to-end tests (an `.xz` file with a delta filter).\r\n- [x] Integrated into OpenFA's GeoTiff parser and demonstrated equivalent function to liblzma. \r\n- [x] Ran `cargo bench` to verify there were no performance regressions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Supporting Documentation and References\r\n\r\nCode for the delta filter was adapted from the C code in [xz-file-format.txt](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/blob/master/doc/xz-file-format.txt).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-02T02:45:23Z","updated_at":"2023-11-11T14:38:37Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fdaa94b952315b8739e32f78782a681f504619a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2037996122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM3OTk2MTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gendx/lzma-rs/labels/waiting%20on%20author","name":"waiting

I need a native rust implementation of lzma decompression for use in [OpenFA](https://openfa.org), so that I can port it to run on the web.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\n\r\nThis pull request was tested by...\r\n\r\n- [x] Added relevant end-to-end tests (an `.xz` file with a delta filter).\r\n- [x] Integrated into OpenFA's GeoTiff parser and demonstrated equivalent function to liblzma. \r\n- [x] Ran `cargo bench` to verify there were no performance regressions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Supporting Documentation and References\r\n\r\nCode for the delta filter was adapted from the C code in [xz-file-format.txt](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/blob/master/doc/xz-file-format.txt).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-02T02:45:23Z","updated_at":"2023-11-11T14:39:19Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fdaa94b952315b8739e32f78782a681f504619a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2037996122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM3OTk2MTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gendx/lzma-rs/labels/waiting%20on%20author","name":"waiting

I need a native rust implementation of lzma decompression for use in [OpenFA](https://openfa.org), so that I can port it to run on the web.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\n\r\nThis pull request was tested by...\r\n\r\n- [x] Added relevant end-to-end tests (an `.xz` file with a delta filter).\r\n- [x] Integrated into OpenFA's GeoTiff parser and demonstrated equivalent function to liblzma. \r\n- [x] Ran `cargo bench` to verify there were no performance regressions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Supporting Documentation and References\r\n\r\nCode for the delta filter was adapted from the C code in [xz-file-format.txt](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/blob/master/doc/xz-file-format.txt).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-02T02:45:23Z","updated_at":"2023-11-11T14:39:19Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fdaa94b952315b8739e32f78782a681f504619a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2037996122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM3OTk2MTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gendx/lzma-rs/labels/waiting%20on%20author","name":"waiting
