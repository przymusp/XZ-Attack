5.4.6\r\n\r\n**Destination channel:** defaults\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n\r\n- [PKG-4149](https://anaconda.atlassian.net/browse/PKG-4149) \r\n- [Upstream repository](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/tree/v5.4.6)\r\n- [Upstream changelog/diff](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/compare/v5.4.5...v5.4.6)\r\n\r\n### Explanation of changes:\r\n\r\n- Copy the pkgconfig file `liblzma.pc` on `win`\r\n- Update `source/url` because `WARNING: Error: HTTP 404 NOT FOUND for url <https://sourceforge.net/projects/lzmautils/files/xz-5.6.0.tar.bz2>`\r\n- Add new test commands\r\n- Update home url\r\n- Update dev_url\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n- It was found that `liblzma.pc` file is missing on **win64** but it's required by `r-cairo` package. `r-cairo` has a couple of problems:\r\n  - it really wants a `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` to point to `%LIBRARY_LIB%/pkgconfig` to pick up `cairo`, `libtiff` and `libjpeg` info\r\n  - `libtiff` wants to use `liblzma` (which _MSYS2_ supplies separately as `msys2-liblzma` but is bundled in `xz` in **defaults**) and the defaults package doesn't have a `liblzma.pc `file -- it is created during a build but not obviously copied for install.\r\n- We do not build the latest version **5.6.0** yet because of the significant changes, see https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/releases/tag/v5.6.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n[PKG-4149]:
