for the PR. This is a great start to improving the fuzz testing. I will start with a few overall comments here and then add some more specific comments directly on the commits themselves.\r\n\r\nFirst, we need to be sure that we are using the fuzz resources in the best way we can. Its easy to think of the OSS-Fuzz resources as unlimited, but each project can only be fuzzed so much. We should only include a fuzz target if it provides clear value and is testing an important part of liblzma that isn't being covered by a different fuzz target. Otherwise, less useful fuzz targets will take away compute time from the more useful ones. So, can you justify the reasoning behind each of the new fuzz targets? For instance, I am not sure that the raw encoder and decoder fuzz targets are useful since their important code paths are already covered by every other fuzz target. The raw coders don't have important header data, its just raw LZMA data. I am likely missing an important fuzz case, but in my mind I can think of three useful things to fuzz in our library:\r\n\r\n- Metadata encoding/decoding (magic bytes, file headers, block headers, lzma2 chunk headers, etc.)\r\n- Filter data encoding/decoding (LZMA1, BCJ, delta)\r\n- Check functions (CRC32, CRC64, SHA256)\r\n\r\nNext, the code itself has a lot of repeated boilerplate. Each of the fuzz targets has very little unique code. For instance, this could be reorganized into a shared header file that provides a function for encoding and a function for decoding. These functions can take the coder init function (lzma_alone_decoder(), lzma_auto_decoder(), etc.) as a function pointer arg and any needed flags or options.\r\n\r\nWe could also consider fuzzing the various BCJ filters (x86, PowerPC, ARM64, etc). These filters are designed to be applied to executable data, but will be run on non-executable data very often. So its possible that there are hidden data corruption bugs on an unexpected input sequence since they are mostly tested on executable data, making it a good candidate for fuzz testing. These filters cannot be used as raw coders at this time, so they will have to be combined in a filter chain with LZMA1/2. If we want to look for data corruption bugs, we should encode a chunk, then decode it and compare if the decoded version exactly matches the original data.\r\n\r\nFor your commit messages, we like to keep a consistent format. When we release, our Changelog is generated automatically from the contents of the commit messages. Also it helps us maintain our codebase better when the commit messages are descriptive and clear. For your commits, please have them start with the category of what they are changing. For these, I would prepend \"Tests:\" to the first line of each commit. The first line of each commit should be a brief description of the purpose of the commit. The following lines should explain what was changed and why. Make sure to wrap the lines of the commit message to at most 73 characters since different commit log viewers may or may not wrap long lines and it helps keep a consistent look in our Changelog.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1831864854/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-11-29T13:07:44Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
