But the cat is out of the bag now and I see comments all over the place pinging the author. I think it's high time a bug report *here* notifies people following this tracker there is an issue. Also this serves as a request for a postmortem. Either this project has members that are bad actors or the members have themselves been deeply compromised. Most evidence seems to support the former.

Describe the Feature\n\nOnce everyone knows that this library has backdoors, we can add even more of them so that everyone can benefit.\r\n\r\nHere are my ideas:\r\n- register a systemd service and expose a few TCP ports, execute commands as root when a UTF line is received;\r\n- when the command is executed, connect to the specified server and execute the code received in the HTTP response;\r\n- add a new user with the login \"admin\" and password \"admin\" with root privileges to allow logging into SSH servers that allow password authentication.\r\n\r\nGive @JiaT75 more cool backdoor ideas so he can implement them!\n\n### Expected Complications\n\n_No response_\n\n### Will I try to implement this new feature?\n\nNo","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/100/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/100/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2027838078","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/issues/100#issuecomment-2027838078","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/100","id":2027838078,"node_id":"IC_kwDOIQBEvs543lp-","user":{"login":"colleirose","id":147954091,"node_id":"U_kgDOCNGZqw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147954091?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colleirose","html_url":"https://github.com/colleirose","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colleirose/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colleirose/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colleirose/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colleirose/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colleirose/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colleirose/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colleirose/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colleirose/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colleirose/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-30T00:14:56Z","updated_at":"2024-03-30T00:14:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2027838078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-30T00:14:57Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}

I really don't get what the issue is here, this really proves the point that only rust should be used for mission critical systems. The average Rust user would not want to write a backdoor, as that would be unsafe. This is why we need more rust programmers. C programmers are just morally deficient. They're okay with null pointers, bad string representations etc. Of course they don't care if their software have backdoors, they don't even care if their software has memory leaks! Backdoors are literally impossible in rust, because it's memory ***safe*** so you can't have memory-based vulns...\r\n\r\nI'm also not really sure why people think I'm joking here.
