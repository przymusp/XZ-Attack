While development of Asciidoctor 2.1 is beginning to pick up again, we extracted several other important improvements and bug fixes from main to include in this patch release.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most critical fix in this release is to make Asciidoctor&#39;s logger compatible with the logger API in Ruby 3.3.&#xD;&#xA;The code is now tested against Ruby 3.3 on each change.&#xD;&#xA;Nearly as important, this release also turns off Ruby&#39;s system-dependent newline conversion when writing files so that Asciidoctor&#39;s output is consistent between *nix and Windows.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Numerous changes were made to correct AsciiDoc parsing. A nested dlist attached using a list continuation no longer consumes a detached paragraph. And an attached block is correctly attached to a nested dlist when that dlist is offset from its parent by an empty line. The secondary and tertiary terms on the `indexterm` macro are preserved when the primary term is quoted and contains an equals sign. And a bare URL enclosed in angle brackets acts as unconstrained syntax that stops at the first occurrence of a closing angle bracket. When includes are not enabled, any spaces in the include target are preserved when generating the fallback link.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Several changes were made to the DocBook output to address compliance. The abstract is moved inside the `&lt;info&gt;` tag (applies to both the abstract in the preamble as well an an abstract for a book part). The `scaledwidth` and `scale` attributes are now supported on an inline macro, like with a block image macro. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A few changes to the manpage output were made. Cells in the head row are styled as bold. Paragraph breaks in a normal table cell are preserved.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, a few refinements to the default stylesheet were applied. The extra border below the doctitle when the sidebar toc is collapsed into main content area was removed. And a text decoration was added to the active footnote number link in the footnotes list.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Distribution&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [RubyGem (asciidoctor)](https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Asciidoctor is also packaged for [Fedora](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor), [Debian](https://packages.debian.org/sid/asciidoctor), [Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=asciidoctor), [Alpine Linux](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=asciidoctor), [OpenSUSE](https://software.opensuse.org/package/rubygem-asciidoctor), and [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/asciidoctor).
