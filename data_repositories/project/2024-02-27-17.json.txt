It will show some information\nabout memory usage.\n\nWith `-9` the _compressor_ in threaded mode needs 1250 MiB per thread. A\nnew thread is started every 192 MiB of uncompressed input (3 * 64 MiB\nwhere 64 MiB is the dictionary size at `-9`). So if the input file isn't\nhuge, not many threads will be actually used.\n\nWith lower presets memory usage goes down and threads are started more\nfrequently. For example, `-6` starts a new thread every 24 MiB of input\nby default.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1967203067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-27T17:13:45Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
