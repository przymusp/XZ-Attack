Actions referenced by tags and branches are more vulnerable to attacks, such as the tag being moved to a malicious commit or a malicious commit being pushed to the branch.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are pros and cons for each reference, GitHub understands [using commit SHAs is more reliable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/finding-and-customizing-actions#using-shas), as does [Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#pinned-dependencies) security tool.\r\n\r\nIf you agree, this would change, for example, `actions/checkout@v3` to `actions/checkout@f43a0e5ff2bd294095638e18286ca9a3d1956744` followed by a comment `# v3.6.0` to keep the version readable. Additionally, we can take this moment to bump `actions/checkout` to `v4` and other actions.\r\n\r\n### Expected Complications\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Will I try to implement this new feature?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n##### Additional Context\r\n\r\nHi! I'm Gabriela and I work on behalf of Google and the OpenSSF suggesting supply-chain security changes :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/65/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/65/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1735447590","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/issues/65#issuecomment-1735447590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/65","id":1735447590,"node_id":"IC_kwDOIQBEvs5ncNQm","user":{"login":"JiaT75","id":78042786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDQyNzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78042786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaT75","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-26T12:29:05Z","updated_at":"2023-09-26T12:29:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hello!\r\n\r\nThanks again for the security advice.
