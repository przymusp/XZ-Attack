This is how it was\nsupposed to work since the beginning but this was broken by\nthe commit 231c3c7098f1099a56abb8afece76fc9b8699f05, that is,\na little before 5.0.0 was released. The buggy behavior displayed\na message, set exit status 1 (error), and xz didn't attempt to\nto decompress the file.\n\nThis doesn't matter today except for special builds that disable\nCRC64 or SHA-256 at build time (but such builds should be used\nin special situations only). The bug matters if new check type\nis added in the future and an old xz version is used to decompress\nsuch a file; however, it's likely that such files would use a new\nfilter too and an old xz wouldn't be able to decompress the file\nanyway.\n\nThe first hunk in the commit is the actual fix. The second hunk\nis a cleanup since LZMA_TELL_ANY_CHECK isn't used in xz.\n\nThere is a test file for unsupported check type but it wasn't\nused by test_files.sh, perhaps due to different behavior between\nxz and the simpler xzdec.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/commits/f9913e8ee2ba0b1e4ff4d0aa4c001aae305ed944"},{"sha":"563288ea705e83ff5cb292adf794650c263bca1d","author":{"email":"lasse.collin@tukaani.org","name":"Lasse Collin"},"message":"xz: Add support for OpenBSD's pledge() sandbox.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/commits/563288ea705e83ff5cb292adf794650c263bca1d"},{"sha":"054ccd6d14b2cc6eddc56897af280d3221414150","author":{"email":"lasse.collin@tukaani.org","name":"Lasse Collin"},"message":"xz: Fix --single-stream with an empty .xz Stream.\n\nExample:\n\n    $ xz -dc --single-stream good-0-empty.xz\n    xz: good-0-empty.xz: Internal error (bug)\n\nThe code, that is tries to catch some input file issues early,\ndidn't anticipate LZMA_STREAM_END which is possible in that\ncode only when --single-stream is used.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/commits/054ccd6d14b2cc6eddc56897af280d3221414150"},{"sha":"59c4d6e1390f6f4176f43ac1dad1f7ac03c449b8","author":{"email":"lasse.collin@tukaani.org","name":"Lasse Collin"},"message":"Build: Add configure option --disable-microlzma.\n\nMicroLZMA was made for EROFS and used by erofs-utils.\nIt might be used by something else in the future but\nthose wanting a smaller build for specific situations\ncan now disable this rarely-needed feature.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/commits/59c4d6e1390f6f4176f43ac1dad1f7ac03c449b8"},{"sha":"04f299b64e73f50afc188c2590ebebc6b73ed744","author":{"email":"lasse.collin@tukaani.org","name":"Lasse Collin"},"message":"Build: Update m4/ax_pthread.m4 from Autoconf Archive.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/commits/04f299b64e73f50afc188c2590ebebc6b73ed744"},{"sha":"a4b214b93ac741edef9c41e55865b0b867ca2587","author":{"email":"lasse.collin@tukaani.org","name":"Lasse Collin"},"message":"Build: Use AC_CONFIG_HEADERS instead of the ancient AC_CONFIG_HEADER.\n\nWe require Autoconf >= 2.69 and that has AC_CONFIG_HEADERS.\n\nThere is a warning about AC_PROG_CC_C99 being obsolete but\nit cannot be removed because it is needed with Autoconf 2.69.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/commits/a4b214b93ac741edef9c41e55865b0b867ca2587"},{"sha":"89c5cfcacaca7130509fac836e2f30c46b824502","author":{"email":"lasse.collin@tukaani.org","name":"Lasse Collin"},"message":"Tests: Test also unsupported-*.xz.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/commits/89c5cfcacaca7130509fac836e2f30c46b824502"},{"sha":"ce30ada91951d0746879ae438da11f1ee8a90aa0","author":{"email":"jiat0218@gmail.com","name":"Jia Tan"},"message":"Tests: test_bcj_exact_size skips properly now if PowerPC filter disabled.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/commits/ce30ada91951d0746879ae438da11f1ee8a90aa0"},{"sha":"c1dd8524e1af07f16b790463899de06a6a5fcc08","author":{"email":"lasse.collin@tukaani.org","name":"Lasse Collin"},"message":"Tests: Keep test_compress_* working when some filters are unavailable.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/commits/c1dd8524e1af07f16b790463899de06a6a5fcc08"},{"sha":"798c86e4231e0835ab76ccd0810c8ea30833b2ce","author":{"email":"lasse.collin@tukaani.org","name":"Lasse Collin"},"message":"Tests: test_files.sh: Print the reason for skipping if xz & xzdec missing.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/commits/798c86e4231e0835ab76ccd0810c8ea30833b2ce"},{"sha":"b3459327a51f4b8239d19e6c34b4e0c6bc2d81de","author":{"email":"lasse.collin@tukaani.org","name":"Lasse Collin"},"message":"Tests: test_files.sh: Suppress an expected warning from the log.\n\nxz (but not xzdec) will normally warn about unsupported check\nbut since we are testing specifically such a file, it's better\nto silence that warning so that it doesn't look suspicious in\ntest_files.sh.log.\n\nThe use of -q and -Q in xzdec is just for consistency and\ndoesn't affect the result at least for now.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/commits/b3459327a51f4b8239d19e6c34b4e0c6bc2d81de"},{"sha":"05c72de06fcaaedc78f8abba7d5ec568ddcf1e75","author":{"email":"lasse.collin@tukaani.org","name":"Lasse Collin"},"message":"Tests: test_files.sh: Make it not fail if features were disabled at build.\n\nIt now tries to test as many files as easily possible.\nThe exit status indicates skipping if any of the files were\nskipped.
