This is preventive action to keep your workflows safe. The `ci.yml` workflow jobs need just minimum permissions `contents: read`, and the default GitHub permissions are higher.\r\n\r\nThis is considered good-practice and is recommended by [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication) itself and other security tools, such as [Scorecards](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication) and [StepSecurity](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication).\r\n\r\n##### Additional Context\r\nI'm Gabriela and I work on behalf of Google and the OpenSSF suggesting supply-chain security changes :)\n\n### Expected Complications\n\nNo.\n\n### Will I try to implement this new feature?\n\nYes","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/38/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/38/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-22T17:44:58Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
