Along with MSVC CMake of course. The other ones either don't run on x86-64 (which is what the GitHub-hosted runners support), or are the same but just use clang. The clang build is already tested by the MacOS runner, so its probably not necessary to test it on Windows. \r\n\r\nI don't develop or use xz or liblzma on Windows, but we have a few users who do. My note about MinGw and CMake was more about testing the autotool and CMake builds on Windows. So, I think using msys2 makes sense since it is likely many of our users do so.\r\n\r\nTo start, I think just picking one environment would be great. I feel the most useful one would be UCRT64 if we also have CMake testing msvcrt. Since we already have a lot of runners and configurations, maybe the other environments could be in a separate Workflow that we run manually pre-release or if we are addressing a Windows specific bug.\r\n\r\nThanks for offering to help with this! I was planning on working on this soon, but I kept delaying it to work on other things. Your help would be greatly appreciated if you have the time to do it :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1400336254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-01-23T13:25:32Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
