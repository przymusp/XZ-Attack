The API and ABI are still backward compatible with liblzma\n        5.4.x and 5.2.x and 5.0.x.\n\n        NOTE: As described in the NEWS for 5.5.2beta, the core components\n        are now under the BSD Zero Clause License (0BSD).\n\n        Since 5.5.2beta:\n\n        * liblzma:\n\n            - Disabled the branchless C variant in the LZMA decoder based\n              on the benchmark results from the community.\n\n            - Disabled x86-64 inline assembly on x32 to fix the build.\n\n        * Sandboxing support in xz:\n\n            - Landlock is now used even when xz needs to create files.\n              In this case the sandbox is has to be more permissive than\n              when no files need to be created. A similar thing was\n              already in use with pledge(2) since 5.3.4alpha.\n\n            - Landlock and pledge(2) are now stricter when reading from\n              more than one input file and only writing to standard output.\n\n            - Added support for Landlock ABI version 4.\n\n        * CMake:\n\n            - Default to -O2 instead of -O3 with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release.\n              -O3 is not useful for speed and makes the code larger.\n\n            - Now builds lzmainfo and lzmadec.\n\n            - xzdiff, xzgrep, xzless, xzmore, and their symlinks are now\n              installed. The scripts are also tested during \"make test\".\n\n            - Added translation support for xz, lzmainfo, and the\n              man pages.\n\n            - Applied the symbol versioning workaround for MicroBlaze that\n              is used in the Autotools build.\n\n            - The general XZ Utils and liblzma API documentation is now\n              installed.\n\n            - The CMake component names were changed a little and several\n              were added. liblzma_Runtime and liblzma_Development are\n              unchanged.\n\n            - Minimum required CMake version is now 3.14. However,\n              translation support is disabled with CMake versions\n              older than 3.20.\n\n            - The CMake-based build is now close to feature parity with the\n              Autotools-based build. Most importantly a few tests aren't\n              run yet. Testing the CMake-based build on different operating\n              systems would be welcome now. See the comment at the top of\n              CMakeLists.txt.\n\n        * Fixed a bug in the Autotools feature test for ARM64 CRC32\n          instruction support for old versions of Clang. This did not\n          affect the CMake build.\n\n        * Windows:\n\n            - The build instructions in INSTALL and windows/INSTALL*.txt\n              were revised completely.\n\n            - windows/build-with-cmake.bat along with the instructions\n              in windows/INSTALL-MinGW-w64_with_CMake.txt should make\n              it very easy to build liblzma.dll and xz.exe on Windows\n              using CMake and MinGW-w64 with either GCC or Clang/LLVM.\n\n            - windows/build.bash was updated. It now works on MSYS2 and\n              on GNU/Linux (cross-compiling) to create a .zip and .7z\n              package for 32-bit and 64-bit x86 using GCC + MinGW-w64.\n\n        * The TODO file is no longer installed as part of the\n          documentation. The file is out of date and does not reflect\n          the actual tasks that will be completed in the future.\n\n        * Translations:\n\n            - Translated lzmainfo man pages are now installed. These\n              had been forgotten in earlier versions.\n\n            - Updated Croatian, Esperanto, German, Hungarian, Korean,\n              Polish, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Vietnamese, and Ukrainian\n              translations.\n\n            - Updated German, Korean, Romanian, and Ukrainian man page\n              translations.\n\n        * Added a few tests.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nðŸ“… **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\nðŸš¦ **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\nâ™» **Rebasing**: Whenever PR becomes conflicted, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\nðŸ”• **Ignore**: Close this PR and you won't be reminded about this update again.\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n\n---\n\nThis PR has been generated by [Mend Renovate](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/).

It will scan repositories for package manager files (e.g. from npm/Yarn, Bundler, Composer, Go Modules, Pip/Pipenv/Poetry, Maven/Gradle, Dockerfile/k8s, and many more), and submit Pull Requests with updated versions whenever they are found.\r\n\r\nThis app is free to install for both public and private repositories. Service is provided complimentary of Mend (formerly known as WhiteSource) and no paid plan is required.\r\n\r\n### Intelligent, helpful onboarding\r\n\r\n![Onboarding](https://docs.renovatebot.com/assets/images/onboarding.png)\r\n\r\nInstall Mend Renovate risk-free and you'll first receive an onboarding Pull Request in each repository. It analyzes the repository files and describes what will happen next, so there's no surprises. \r\n\r\n### Unopinionated, highly flexible configuration\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"rangeStrategy\": \"pin\",\r\n  \"ignorePaths\": [\"examples/**\"],\r\n  \"packageRules\": [{\r\n    \"packagePatterns\": [\"^angular.*\"],\r\n    \"groupName\": \"angular\",\r\n    \"automerge\": true\r\n  }]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nModify any of Renovate's smart defaults with custom overrides at the repository, package file, dependency type, and package levels. \r\n\r\n### Support for monorepo directory structures\r\n\r\nRenovate will scan all files in each repository to look for relevant package files. It will also group upgrades from the same monorepo into a single PR to ensure tests pass and PR noise is reduced. Natively supports Lerna and Yarn Workspaces with zero configuration necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is also works fine with a mix of package managers / languages within the same repository.\r\n\r\n### Automatic lock file and checksum support\r\n\r\nRenovate will generate updated lock files such as `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` if you're already using them. It will also automatically resolve any conflicts after merges.\r\n\r\n### Ease the noise with custom schedules\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"timezone\": \"America/New_York\",\r\n  \"schedule\": \"before 5am every weekday\",\r\n  \"lockFileMaintenance\": {\r\n    \"enabled\": true,\r\n    \"schedule\": \"after 10pm on sunday\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"packageRules\": [{\r\n    \"packageNames\": [\"aws-sdk\"],\r\n    \"schedule\": \"before 5am every wednesday\"\r\n  }]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThrottle updates however you want with schedules, configurable right down to the per-package level.\r\n\r\n### Rules-based automerging\r\n\r\n![automerging](https://docs.renovatebot.com/assets/images/automerged-pr.png)\r\n\r\nMerge some updates without human intervention if they pass tests and satisfy your automerge rules.","external_url":"https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/renovate","created_at":"2017-06-02T07:04:12Z","updated_at":"2023-11-06T09:25:36Z","permissions":{"administration":"read","checks":"write","contents":"write","emails":"read","issues":"write","members":"read","metadata":"read","packages":"read","pull_requests":"write","statuses":"write","vulnerability_alerts":"read","workflows":"write"},"events":["issues","pull_request","push","repository"]}}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-26T22:18:02Z","org":{"id":101227423,"login":"spacedriveapp","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/spacedriveapp","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101227423?"}}
