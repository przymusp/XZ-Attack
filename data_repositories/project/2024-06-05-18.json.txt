I now think that `add_support_ios.patch` never made any sense other than forcing the build to succeed for users that only wanted liblzma. From [Apple's docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/AboutBundles/AboutBundles.html): \"_Static libraries, dynamic libraries, shell scripts, and UNIX command line tools do not use the bundle structure._\" Thus, [the commit from 2020](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/21588ca34af98738954fc12ded1b89d7294ef646) is correct. The bug reporter had confirmed to me via email that the commit fixed the build on iOS. So `add_support_ios.patch` should be removed as it nowadays does nothing.\r\n\r\nvcpkg doesn't want bundles, so the patch indicated a problem IMO. But I don't use iOS...\r\n\r\n> 3. The equivalent of `win_output_name.patch` (without `IMPORT_PREFIX \"\"`) is now in [upstream repository](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/e0d6d05ce0d464e966c0669bbf869202a43cc2f7). It fixed naming bugs on Cygwin and MSYS2 too, that is, my old method was fundamentally wrong. Note that `win_output_name.patch` in this PR is currently buggy because it has `IMPORT_PREFIX \"\"` (it must have been a merge conflict when the patch was updated but it still wasn't noticed).\r\n\r\n:heart:\r\nThis was always a candidate for upstreaming but i was hesitating.\r\n\r\n> 5. `liblzma.pc` is now installed [even when building with MSVC](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/afa938e429c1ce07d26d02999352fb014b62ff3d). The generated `liblzma.pc` now [uses paths that are relative](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/5d1c649ba9eb7a5b9371252ebfbc2911dc774e69) to `${prefix}`. I have no idea if it helps in `portfile.cmake` though, that is, if it was now possible to rely on upstream `CMakeLists.txt` to install `liblzma.pc` correctly.\r\n\r\n:rocket:\r\n\r\n> 6. Since XZ Utils 5.6.0, `CMakeLists.txt` installs `xzgrep` and other POSIX shell scripts `if(UNIX)`. These scripts rely on the `xz` tool. I suppose `build-tools.patch` should cover the scripts too as installing the scripts without the `xz` tool makes no sense.\r\n\r\n:+1:\r\nAnd probably not very useful for windows w/o mingw.\r\n\r\n> 7. Excluding the POSIX shell scripts, the command line tools can be built on Windows even with MSVC. This is a new feature since 5.6.0. `vcpkg.json` still has `\"supports\": \"!windows, mingw\"`. I wonder if that was forgotten to be changed (perhaps the info in the NEWS file wasn't noticed) or if it is intentional because the MSVC build of the command line tools link in GNU getopt_long which is under the GNU LGPLv2.1 (not needed with MinGW-w64).\r\n\r\ngetopt_long going into *executables* shouldn't be a barrier, in particular for an optional feature. It is also used by other ports. (And there is a port getopt-win32, but don't ask me about it is security and maintenance.)\r\n\r\n> The Autotools-based build has options to disable individual command line tools but the CMake-based build doesn't. Perhaps such options should be added upstream so that `build-tools.patch` wouldn't be needed here (and perhaps elsewhere) but I didn't do it now. It is possible to build only liblzma by building and installing only the specific CMake components but I understand that it might not be so convenient.\r\n\r\nFor vcpkg, a *single* switch for tools would be enough for this port. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt is fine to make a draft PR for a vcpkg CI run with a pre-release commit, to check if any further tweaks would be needed. That PR can be switched to the release when it is available.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/comments/2150673128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-05T18:15:33Z","org":{"id":6154722,"login":"microsoft","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/microsoft","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?"}}
