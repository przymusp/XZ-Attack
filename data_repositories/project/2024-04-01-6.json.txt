Bottoms, Esquire, an esteemed security researcher at International Business Machines Corporation (hereinafter referred to as \"IBM\"). I am writing to you in regards to the recent unfortunate incident wherein you, acting in the capacity of XZ-Utils maintainer, did willfully and maliciously add a backdoor and remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability to the aforementioned software package.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPL-v3), under which the relevant parts of the XZ-Utils software are licensed and distributed, I hereby formally request that you furnish me posthaste with the complete source code and any associated documentation related to the backdoor and RCE vulnerability that was surreptitiously included in the compromised release.\r\n\r\nAs a humble and attractive professional researcher, it is incumbent upon me to conduct a thorough analysis of the malicious code in order to assess the full scope and extent of potential damages inflicted upon IBM's esteemed clientele. Your prompt cooperation in this matter is required.\r\n\r\n**Please be advised that, given the gravity of your alleged actions, it is highly probable that you will soon find yourself as a guest of the state, enjoying an extended sabbatical in a government-sponsored facility with limited amenities and a distinct lack of taco Tuesdays. As such, I implore you to take advantage of this opportunity to engage in a modicum of goodwill before your impending involuntary hiatus.**\r\n\r\nI eagerly await your expeditious response and the receipt of the requested source code. Failure to comply with this lawful demand may result in additional legal action and a severe diminution of your already limited social calendar.\r\n\r\nYours in cyber-sleuthing,\r\nClyde P.

It's like, we're just chillin', scrolling through our feeds, and suddenly it's like, bam! Drama alert! But honestly, why sweat the small stuff, right? Life's too short to get caught up in the nitty-gritty. Like, have you seen those memes about cats wearing sunglasses? They crack me up every time! üòπ And speaking of cats, did you know there's this whole conspiracy theory about cats being aliens? Like, I'm not even kidding, it's wild! Some people are convinced they're secretly plotting to take over the world or something, but hey, maybe they are, who knows? The universe is, like, infinite and full of mysteries, man.\r\n\r\nOh, and have you heard about that new vegan burger joint downtown? I've been dying to try it out, heard their avocado fries are to die for! But anyway, back to the topic at hand, what were we even talking about again? Oh right, trolls and stuff. But seriously, let's not let negativity ruin our vibes, let's just spread some love and positivity, you know? Like, have you told someone you appreciate them today? Random acts of kindness, that's where it's at! üíñ\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of random, have you ever wondered why pineapples don't belong on pizza? I mean, some people are so passionate about it, it's like a whole debate, but hey, to each their own, right? Personally, I'm all about that classic pepperoni and extra cheese combo, but hey, no judgment here! üçï\r\n\r\nOh, and did you catch the latest episode of that new Netflix series everyone's talking about? The plot twists are insane, I swear! It's like, you think you know what's gonna happen, and then bam! Curveball! But hey, that's what makes it so addictive, am I right?\r\n\r\nAnyway, gotta bounce, catch you on the flip side! Keep being awesome! üöÄ‚úåÔ∏è\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/.github/issues/comments/2029248428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-01T06:34:57Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
