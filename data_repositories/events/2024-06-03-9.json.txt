Possibly a compiler will do the same from the current code too but using a zero makes it explicit. A similar change was done in 2337f7021c860b026e3e849e60a9ae8d09ec0ea0. Using `0U` instead of `0` isn't important here as `uintptr_t` will promote the math to unsigned anyway so it's just what one prefers.\r\n\r\nSome would write just `(-(uintptr_t)buf)` but that can cause warnings due to sign conversion, thus I prefer writing it as a subtraction from zero.","created_at":"2024-06-03T09:52:46Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T09:52:47Z","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/86#discussion_r1624143571","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/86","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/comments/1624143571"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/86#discussion_r1624143571"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/86"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/comments/1624143571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":26,"original_line":26,"side":"RIGHT","original_position":26,"position":26,"subject_type":"line"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/86","id":1742149263,"node_id":"PR_kwDOIQBEvs5n1xaP","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/86","diff_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/86.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/86.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/86","number":86,"state":"closed","locked":false,"title":"Speed
