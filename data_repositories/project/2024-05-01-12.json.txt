The malicious files have been reverted. Even if one checks them out, they are harmless without the trigger code that was never committed to the Git repository. Thus things like `git bisect` are safe to use.\r\n\r\n# Merges\r\n\r\nI don't do merges via GitHub UI. I do merges locally as then the same process works no matter where the Git repository is hosted. The commit 97f0ee0f1f903f4e7c4ea23e9b89d687025d2992 I merged locally without rebasing, thus it shows GitHub as the committer. I might try to avoid this in the future.\r\n\r\nIf I understand it correctly, signing commits without merge commits doesn't sound impractical: Rebase the new commits locally first. Adding `Closes: <URL-to-PR>` to a commit message will close the PR and, even better, this leaves a link to the commit log that points to the PR discussion. Pushing to the submitter's branch (if allowed) before merge could make sense too but I don't know how much it matters if GitHub doesn't show the PR as merged. The discussion should make things clear anyway.\r\n\r\n# Force pushes\r\n\r\n@ItzSwirlz You commented in PR #95 about force pushes.\r\n\r\nI manually mirror to git.tukaani.org where I have never force pushed. Apart from the _very_ early days on GitHub, when the primary repository was still on git.tukaani.org and the repository on GitHub wasn't officially announced anywhere yet, there were no force pushes to the master or v5.x branches on GitHub, or at least I didn't detect any. If they happened, they must have happened so that I never fetched the thrown-away commits.\r\n\r\nTo the xz-java repository on GitHub I had to force push after my account was reinstated because I didn't have a local copy of Jia's last commits (that created `SECURITY.md`). I had already pushed new commits to git.tukaani.org while the repository on GitHub was unavailable to me.\r\n\r\n# Spam problem\r\n\r\n@JohnDoe1001: [This](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz-java/commit/9f00c1d736e07390846f17e538eb854a3e5cede2#commitcomment-141549610) kind of [behavior](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/af071ef7702debef4f1d324616a0137a5001c14c#commitcomment-141549184) isn't acceptable and may earn you a ban instead of maintainer status.\r\n\r\nThe amount of spam on GitHub is distracting from useful activities. There are many places where people can make humor-_only_ posts about the recent events. Everyone, please keep those posts out of GitHub (assuming that you aren't in the enemy team).
