Many of these improvements are already on master but have not made it into a stable release. If you only need `liblzma`, then using a release from the 5.4 branch will work. We will have a new `5.4.5` release later today and that will include a few small CMake changes. We recently ported the command line tools `xz` and `xzdec` to MSVC but that will not be part of any of the 5.4 releases\r\n\r\nWe are planning to release 5.6.0 this December which may change the default library to being a shared library. We may consider our CMake support stable at that point. So, to be safe you should explicitly set the `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` option if you do build `liblzma` through CMake since this option's default value specifically might not be stable.\r\n\r\nIf you can use our Autotools build system on Windows through something like Cygwin or MSYS2, that is recommended over CMake at the moment. If not, our CMake build will likely still work for you, but be careful of minor things changing in the future. We generally don't break things with our CMake build and are usually just adding more features. I hope this answers your question!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1787525956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-10-31T16:05:37Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
