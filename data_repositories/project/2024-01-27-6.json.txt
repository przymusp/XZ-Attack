The bug can only be triggered if\n      lzma_filters_update() is called on a LZMA1 encoder, so it does\n      not affect xz or any application known to us that uses liblzma.\n\n    * xz:\n\n        - Fixed a regression introduced in 5.4.2 that caused encoding\n          in the raw format to unnecessarily fail if --suffix was not\n          used. For instance, the following command no longer reports\n          that --suffix must be used:\n\n              echo foo | xz --format=raw --lzma2 | wc -c\n\n        - Fixed an issue on MinGW-w64 builds that prevented reading\n          from or writing to non-terminal character devices like NUL.\n\n    * Added a new test.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heitbaum/LibreELEC.tv/commits/829229f2bb31c9321d1f8bbe29c95c9cb5471944"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-27T06:50:50Z"}
