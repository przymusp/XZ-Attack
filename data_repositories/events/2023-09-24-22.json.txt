But clock_gettime() is defined\nin winpthreads, and liblzma or xz needs nothing else from\nwinpthreads. By avoiding clock_gettime(), we avoid the dependency on\nlibwinpthread-1.dll or the need to link against the static version.\n\nAs a bonus, GetTickCount64() and MinGW-w64's gettimeofday() can be\nfaster than clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &tv).
