I wonder if JVM is smart enough to vectorize the decoder loops when distance is large enough and appropriate multiple of a power of two. For example, distance=240 is a little faster than 248.\r\n\r\nIt might be. I also used the DeltaEncoder and DeltaDecoder as a means of playing with the Vector api functionality in https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/338, which still has not been fully released. I definitely recall on the encoder side seeing further improvements beyond what was in this PR. (It actually worked the opposite direction, I observed something like 50:1 improvement in performance, on hardware where 32:1 should have been theoretical max. This caused me to revisit the original implementation to see if it could be improved without use of vectors.) While I also worked on the decoder, I do not remember actual performance numbers.\r\n\r\n> In any case, thanks for the improvement and sorry that it has taken three years to get it included.\r\n\r\nJust glad to see it making it :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz-java/issues/comments/1979681544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-05T21:39:35Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
