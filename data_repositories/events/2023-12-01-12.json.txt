Most of our test files are small (I believe the largest is ~50 Kb .xz file) so its likely that the default value is good enough in practice.\r\n\r\nHowever it could be a good idea to set an upper bound on a size we think is reasonable, especially for the fuzz targets that are meant to test handling bytes early in the input stream. So I would vote for this.","created_at":"2023-12-01T12:25:16Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T12:25:16Z","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/73#discussion_r1412044487","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/73","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/comments/1412044487"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/73#discussion_r1412044487"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/73"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/comments/1412044487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":2,"original_line":2,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":1410885678,"original_position":2,"position":2,"subject_type":"line"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/73","id":1619779134,"node_id":"PR_kwDOIQBEvs5gi94-","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/73","diff_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/73.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/73.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/73","number":73,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Improve
