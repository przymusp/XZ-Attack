These changes improve the performance for every platform on jdk9+.\r\n\r\nFor x86 this is done by using a byteArrayViewVarHandle to process 8 (64 bit) or 4 bytes at a time.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase%2F9%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2F%2F/java/lang/invoke/MethodHandles.html#byteArrayViewVarHandle-java.lang.Class-java.nio.ByteOrder-\r\n\r\nFor all other platforms, this uses the Arrays.mismatch method to do the comparison, which is implemented in the jdk itself with vectors.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase%2F9%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2F%2F/java/util/Arrays.html#mismatch-byte:A-int-int-byte:A-int-int-\r\n\r\nFor older jdks (7 and 8) on x86 or aarch64, sun.misc.Unsafe is used (if it can be found) to process 8 (64 bit) or 4 bytes at a time.\r\n\r\nAs previously discussed on the mailing list, this shows substantial improvements (~20%) in total compression times for a variety of real-world data sets for both arm and x86, with only minor regressions if forced (by system property) to legacy byte-by-byte comparisons. https://www.mail-archive.com/xz-devel@tukaani.org/msg00400.html\r\n\r\n\r\nI have additional unit tests specific to the ArrayMismatch implementations, which can be added on top of
