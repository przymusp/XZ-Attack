But the cat is out of the bag now and I see comments all over the place pinging the author. I think it's high time a bug report *here* notifies people following this tracker there is an issue. Also this serves as a request for a postmortem. Either this project has members that are bad actors or the members have themselves been deeply compromised. Most evidence seems to support the former.

Some more complex applications may simply need binary stuff for the sake of time, like sure you can in theory generate image tests for an offline renderer from the renderer itself, but doing so for 100 images may take hours which is not really desirable. Of course in those cases the binary data isn't being extracted or anything...but you get the idea, sometimes using binary blobs makes sense for the sake of time or difficulty in synthesizing the test data.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/comments/140383229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-29T19:29:36Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}

While the intention behind these changes may have been to improve error reporting, there are concerns about potential security implications, especially in light of the recent discovery of a backdoor in the xz utility.\r\n\r\nUpon reviewing the changes, it appears that safe fprintf calls were replaced with unsafe fprintf calls in the error handling code. This alteration raises concerns about the possibility of introducing vulnerabilities, particularly if terminal escape sequences or other forms of exploitation are inadvertently included in error messages.\r\n\r\nGiven the sensitivity of the situation and the potential for similar vulnerabilities, I believe it's crucial for the project maintainers to thoroughly assess these changes and ensure that they do not inadvertently introduce security risks. Additionally, considering the recent backdoor discovery, it's important to prioritize the security and integrity of the xz utility.\r\n\r\nProposed Actions:\r\n\r\n    Revert the changes made to the error handling code, restoring the use of safe fprintf calls.\r\n    Use archive_errno instead of errno for error handling to mitigate potential risks associated with including terminal escape sequences in error messages.\r\n    Conduct a thorough review of the codebase to identify and address any other potential security concerns.\r\n\r\nAdditional Context:\r\n\r\n    Link to the relevant MR or commit where the changes were made.\r\n    Reference to any discussions or concerns raised by other contributors or community members.\r\n    Any other relevant information or insights that could aid in understanding the issue and its implications.\r\n\r\nRequest for Response:\r\nI kindly request a response from the project maintainers regarding these security concerns and proposed actions. Transparency and collaboration are essential in addressing potential security vulnerabilities and ensuring the continued trust and reliability of the xz utility.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\n### Version\n\n5.6.0/5.6.1\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/94/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/94/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-29T19:33:23Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}

While the intention behind these changes may have been to improve error reporting, there are concerns about potential security implications, especially in light of the recent discovery of a backdoor in the xz utility.\r\n\r\nUpon reviewing the changes, it appears that safe fprintf calls were replaced with unsafe fprintf calls in the error handling code. This alteration raises concerns about the possibility of introducing vulnerabilities, particularly if terminal escape sequences or other forms of exploitation are inadvertently included in error messages.\r\n\r\nGiven the sensitivity of the situation and the potential for similar vulnerabilities, I believe it's crucial for the project maintainers to thoroughly assess these changes and ensure that they do not inadvertently introduce security risks. Additionally, considering the recent backdoor discovery, it's important to prioritize the security and integrity of the xz utility.\r\n\r\nProposed Actions:\r\n\r\n    Revert the changes made to the error handling code, restoring the use of safe fprintf calls.\r\n    Use archive_errno instead of errno for error handling to mitigate potential risks associated with including terminal escape sequences in error messages.\r\n    Conduct a thorough review of the codebase to identify and address any other potential security concerns.\r\n\r\nAdditional Context:\r\n\r\n    Link to the relevant MR or commit where the changes were made.\r\n    Reference to any discussions or concerns raised by other contributors or community members.\r\n    Any other relevant information or insights that could aid in understanding the issue and its implications.\r\n\r\nRequest for Response:\r\nI kindly request a response from the project maintainers regarding these security concerns and proposed actions. Transparency and collaboration are essential in addressing potential security vulnerabilities and ensuring the continued trust and reliability of the xz utility.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\n### Version\n\n5.6.0/5.6.1\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/94/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/94/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2027661764","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/issues/94#issuecomment-2027661764","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/94","id":2027661764,"node_id":"IC_kwDOIQBEvs5426nE","user":{"login":"abysssdweller","id":107694411,"node_id":"U_kgDOBmtJSw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107694411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abysssdweller","html_url":"https://github.com/abysssdweller","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abysssdweller/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abysssdweller/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abysssdweller/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abysssdweller/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abysssdweller/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abysssdweller/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abysssdweller/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abysssdweller/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abysssdweller/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-29T19:35:01Z","updated_at":"2024-03-29T19:35:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"also tarballs \r\n![image](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/assets/107694411/9ac0cc74-83e4-460b-9dc8-44d85192e0a6)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2027661764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-29T19:35:02Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}

Idk how big this attack was specifically but given the analysis of it, it sounds like it has a fair bit of code to inject its payload and to compromise the RSA function it replaces.\r\n\r\nBut yes generally I wouldn't say \"binary blob = bad\", just perhaps developers of projects which can benefit from source-only test synthesis should do that for higher assurance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/comments/140383378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-29T19:36:35Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}

calculate the CRC32 result for 1/2/4/8 bytes in a single operation, making the use of LoongArch CRC32 instructions much faster compared to the general CRC32 algorithm.\r\n\r\nOptimized CRC32 will be enabled if the kernel declares the LoongArch CRC32 instructions supported via AT_HWCAP.\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking

Various other commits and changes to say the build script were done to get this to work.

an implementation for crc32 that makes use of clmul.\r\nCode for this implementation was written by Ilya Kurdyukov and can be found here.\r\nhttps://github.com/ilyakurdyukov/crc-clmul-sim\r\n\r\nAlso refactored crc64_clmul to use the new macros created for crc32_clmul.\r\nAs well as moved similar functions to crc_clmul_common to eliminate duplicate code.\r\n\r\nI tested this on files doubling in size starting from 1 byte up to 1 Gigabyte.\r\nDuring testing I found that crc32_clmul can run up to 70% faster than crc32_generic,\r\nand has an average speed increase of 58.4% for sizes greater than 16 bytes.\r\n\r\nI also used this to test the reworked version of crc64_clmul.\r\nThis version of crc64_clmul is an average of 3.9% faster than the original implementation.\r\nThis speed increase is due to some inline assembly as well as changing around the order of some if statements. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been reviewed and added / updated if needed (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Build was run locally and without warnings or errors\r\n- [X] All previous and new tests pass\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request type\r\n\r\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type, submit multiple\r\npull requests if needed. --> \r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [X] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, renaming, typo fix)\r\n- [X] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other (please describe): \r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\ncrc32\\_fast currently only uses a generic implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nI added an implementation for crc32 that makes use of clmul in crc32_fast.c \r\nAlso refactored crc64_clmul implementation to use the same macros as crc32_clmul\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nHere is the output from both tests that gave me the statistics above.\r\n\r\nthe number of unique files tested on and the number of times the crc is run\r\ndecrease as the bytes get larger so the benchmark does not take too long.\r\n\r\nThe 64 and 32 spd+ show the percentage speed increase over the generic.\r\nThe percentage on the graph show the combined average for all types.\r\nFor example (50% is twice as fast, 200% is twice as slow)\r\n```\r\n64 generic: #\t\t64 clmul: +\r\n32 generic: =\t\t32 clmul: *\r\n\r\n#bytes, #files,   #crc's,  64spd+,  32spd+: 0%          50%          100%        150%         200%\r\n

While the intention behind these changes may have been to improve error reporting, there are concerns about potential security implications, especially in light of the recent discovery of a backdoor in the xz utility.\r\n\r\nUpon reviewing the changes, it appears that safe fprintf calls were replaced with unsafe fprintf calls in the error handling code.

This alteration raises concerns about the possibility of introducing vulnerabilities, particularly if terminal escape sequences or other forms of exploitation are inadvertently included in error messages.\r\n\r\nGiven the sensitivity of the situation and the potential for similar vulnerabilities, I believe it's crucial for the project maintainers to thoroughly assess these changes and ensure that they do not inadvertently introduce security risks.
