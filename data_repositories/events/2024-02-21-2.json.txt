While development of Asciidoctor 2.1 is beginning to pick up again, we extracted several other important improvements and bug fixes from main to include in this patch release.\r\n\r\nThe most critical fix in this release is to make Asciidoctor's logger compatible with the logger API in Ruby 3.3.\r\nThe code is now tested against Ruby 3.3 on each change.\r\nNearly as important, this release also turns off Ruby's system-dependent newline conversion when writing files so that Asciidoctor's output is consistent between *nix and Windows.\r\n\r\nNumerous changes were made to correct AsciiDoc parsing. A nested dlist attached using a list continuation no longer consumes a detached paragraph. And an attached block is correctly attached to a nested dlist when that dlist is offset from its parent by an empty line. The secondary and tertiary terms on the `indexterm` macro are preserved when the primary term is quoted and contains an equals sign. And a bare URL enclosed in angle brackets acts as unconstrained syntax that stops at the first occurrence of a closing angle bracket. When includes are not enabled, any spaces in the include target are preserved when generating the fallback link.\r\n\r\nSeveral changes were made to the DocBook output to address compliance. The abstract is moved inside the `<info>` tag (applies to both the abstract in the preamble as well an an abstract for a book part). The `scaledwidth` and `scale` attributes are now supported on an inline macro, like with a block image macro. \r\n\r\nA few changes to the manpage output were made. Cells in the head row are styled as bold. Paragraph breaks in a normal table cell are preserved.\r\n\r\nFinally, a few refinements to the default stylesheet were applied. The extra border below the doctitle when the sidebar toc is collapsed into main content area was removed. And a text decoration was added to the active footnote number link in the footnotes list.\r\n\r\n## Distribution\r\n\r\n- [RubyGem (asciidoctor)](https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor)\r\n\r\nAsciidoctor is also packaged for [Fedora](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor), [Debian](https://packages.debian.org/sid/asciidoctor), [Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=asciidoctor), [Alpine Linux](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=asciidoctor), [OpenSUSE](https://software.opensuse.org/package/rubygem-asciidoctor), and [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/asciidoctor). You can use the system's package manager to install the package named **asciidoctor**.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Compliance\r\n\r\n* Turn off system-dependent newline conversion when writing
