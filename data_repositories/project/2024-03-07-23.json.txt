An similar change is included in this release.\n  See [2].\n- 0002: Patch no longer needed since the package build recipe sets\n  CFLAGS without -Werror, and the package makefile sets -Werror only\n  by default. See [3], included since version 38.\n- 0003: Rebased on version 39 and renamed to 0001. The patch is also\n  flagged as \"Upstream: Not applicable\".\n- 0004: Patch dropped. Included in this release. See [4].\n\nThis commit also removes all patch entries in \".checkpackageignore\"\n(since the remaining patch has its \"Upstream:\" tag).\n\nThis version 39 also fixes few build failures. Those can be seen by\nrunning the command \"utils/test-pkg -a -p efivar\". The first group\nof build failures is:\n\n                br-arm-basic [28/45]: FAILED\n       br-i386-pentium4-full [31/45]: FAILED\n          br-mips64-n64-full [33/45]: FAILED\n     br-mips64r6-el-hf-glibc [34/45]: FAILED\n              linaro-aarch64 [38/45]: FAILED\n                  linaro-arm [39/45]: FAILED\n\nFixes:\n\n    /buildroot/host/opt/ext-toolchain/bin/../lib/gcc/aarch64-linux-gnu/7.3.1/../../../../aarch64-linux-gnu/bin/ld: .data not found for insert\n    collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\n\nefivar 38 was using linker scripts, which was not working in all\ncases. Those issues are fixed by the upstream commit [5] which\nremoves the use of this linker script (included in this release).\n\nThe \"test-pkg -a -p efivar\" also caught another kind of build\nfailures:\n\n    br-i386-pentium-mmx-musl [32/45]: FAILED\n\nFixes:\n\n    In file included from efivar.h:18,\n                     from efisec.h:24,\n                     from secdb-dump.c:7:\n    list.h: In function 'list_sort':\n    list.h:152:2: warning: implicit declaration of function 'qsort_r'; did you mean 'qsort'?

This is because efivar introduced a usage of the\nqsort_r() libc function, in upstream commit [6], first included in\nversion 38.\n\nMusl libc added the qsort_r() function in upstream commit [7], included in\nversion v1.2.3 (2022-04-07).  So external toolchains including a Musl older\nthan this version will fail.  But given how old this issue is (musql 1.2.3\nis included in Buildroot since 2022.05), this issue is ignored.\n\nuClibc-ng external toolchains are also not affected, since it added\nthe qsort_r() function in commit [8] included since its first version\nv1.0.0 (2015-02-02). So there is no need to exclude external uclibc\ntoolchains.\n\n[1] https://github.com/rhboot/efivar/releases/tag/39\n[2] https://github.com/rhboot/efivar/commit/4f3da3dc351d7743d91327e74fcaaa13299eeb39\n[3] https://github.com/rhboot/efivar/commit/998f617cec92d526e1fadb745673ceef63fa1483\n[4] https://github.com/rhboot/efivar/commit/cece3ffd5be2f8641eb694513f2b73e5eb97ffd3\n[5] https://github.com/rhboot/efivar/commit/cfd686de51494d3e34be896a91835657ccab37d4\n[6] https://github.com/rhboot/efivar/commit/62afa2aa588fb0a6ff56acdd268b9f3c557028b8\n[7] https://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/commit/?id=b76f37fd5625d038141b52184956fb4b7838e9a5\n[8] https://gogs.waldemar-brodkorb.de/oss/uclibc-ng/commit/515d54433138596e81267237542bd9168b8cc787\n\nSigned-off-by: Julien Olivain <ju.o@free.fr>\n[Peter: drop dependency on !external musl]\nSigned-off-by: Peter Korsgaard <peter@korsgaard.com>","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jolivain/buildroot/commits/077741623fcd5372a43dd78719f859c479815901"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-07T23:19:00Z"}
