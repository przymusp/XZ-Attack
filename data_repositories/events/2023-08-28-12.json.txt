While it is a clever idea, the redirections mentioned by @Neustradamus were all projects that moved the official repository from one namespace to another. This is different than redirecting an unaffiliated mirror to the official repository.\r\n\r\nWe announced XZ Utils moved to GitHub many months ago through our public mailing list and project website, so there is not much room for users to complain they were not notified with enough time to update their links :)\r\n\r\nAgain, @simnalamburt is free to maintain this mirror how he pleases, but we do not feel comfortable transferring the official XZ Utils repository to the xz-mirror organization, even for a few minutes. We appreciate the update to xz-mirror/xz's About section notifying users about the location of the official repository and encourage either deprecating this mirror or continuing to keep it up to date. This is important to be sure everyone is using an updated version of our project and makes it easier for us to maintain things.\r\n\r\nSo this may inconvenience a few users who need to update their links but that is the best solution from our perspective.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xz-mirror/xz-mirror/issues/comments/1695637145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-28T12:45:50Z","org":{"id":11079172,"login":"xz-mirror","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/xz-mirror","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11079172?"}}
