# "Wolves in Developersâ€™ Clothing: Analyzing the Software Engineering Practice in the XZ Utils Supply Chain Attack"

## Abstract: 
Open Source Software (OSS) has become a cornerstone of modern software development, offering numerous benefits but also introducing unique vulnerabilities. This paper examines a critical security incident involving the XZ Utils project (CVE-2024-3094), where malicious actors exploited the open-source model to inject a backdoor into a widely-used compression library. Through a comprehensive analysis of the attack timeline, we investigate the software engineering practices employed by the attackers, their evolution over time, and the automated tools utilized in the process. Our study reveals how seemingly beneficial contributions to project management and development infrastructure were leveraged to establish credibility and maintain long-term control. We present a detailed dataset of attacker activities, compare them with legitimate contributor patterns, and identify key red flags that could signal similar attacks in other OSS projects. The findings highlight the need for enhanced vigilance in OSS maintenance, particularly for projects with high impact but low contributor engagement. We conclude by proposing guidelines for improving OSS security and sustainability, emphasizing the importance of community oversight, automated security checks, and support for critical yet under-resourced projects.
