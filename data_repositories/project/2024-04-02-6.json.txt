This is not correct, because `https://` prefix\r\n         claims the proxy is an HTTPS proxy, while your proxy (v2ray, shadowsocksr\r\n         , etc..) is an HTTP proxy.

If you are using Windows, vcpkg will automatically use your Windows IE Proxy Settings\r\n         set by your proxy software. See https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/77\r\n         The value set by your proxy might be wrong, or have same `https://` prefix issue.\r\n      \r\n      3. Your proxy's remote server is out of service.\r\n      \r\n      If you've tried directly download the link, and believe this is not a temporary\r\n      download server failure, please submit an issue at https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/issues\r\n      to report this upstream download server failure.\r\n      \r\n\r\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\r\n  scripts/cmake/vcpkg_download_distfile.cmake:270 (z_vcpkg_download_distfile_show_proxy_and_fail)\r\n  scripts/cmake/vcpkg_from_github.cmake:106 (vcpkg_download_distfile)\r\n  ports/liblzma/portfile.cmake:1 (vcpkg_from_github)\r\n  scripts/ports.cmake:175 (include)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\n```[tasklist]\n### Tasks\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/37911/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/37911/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-02T06:22:40Z","org":{"id":6154722,"login":"microsoft","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/microsoft","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?"}}

Your past history at `Github` is not really convincing enough. For one, all the data on your profile is ripped off from various, unrelated sources. You have little to no history of any contributions (neither public, nor private). Your profile does not even have a single repository that may include even a single line of code. The thing that there's just a single redundant repository makes your words even more worthless. Even if you *do* claim to be a part of IBM, I'm not really sure if that suspicious history of events, or that unconvincing profile with a single follower, is, in the very least, from someone who may be a part of even some unnoticed company, yet far from your claims, of working at IBM. Your style of talk, including those pitifully, uncouth behavior, and your false sense of ascendancy, neither indicates, nor points towards any possible career opportunity, that may be may be even possible for you. Please take these words with a feather-light touch. They are mere results of my observations, of your insolent behavior.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/.github/issues/comments/2031181190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-02T06:34:00Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
