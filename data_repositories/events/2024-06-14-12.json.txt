The builtin `FindLibLZMA` module. This doesn't know that `LZMA_API_STATIC` is needed on Windows when linking against static liblzma. (vcpkg patches it into `lzma.h` but that's a vcpkg-specific thing.) This also doesn't know that `-pthread` might be needed when linking against static liblzma on some platforms.\r\n\r\n2. `liblzma-config.cmake` as installed by `CMakeLists.txt` handles the the above issues. However, other build systems like Autotools don't install the *.cmake files. So one can rely on the *.cmake files only if one knows that liblzma was built with CMake (like in vcpkg but not elsewhere).\r\n\r\n3. If pkg-config is used with all toolchains that also use CMake, then `pkg_check_modules` should always work, right? `liblzma.pc` sets `-DLZMA_API_STATIC` and pthread options for static linking so in this sense it shouldn't be worse than (2).\r\n\r\nThe (1) and (2) are mentioned in vcpkg's `usage` file. That's great at the moment. :-)\r\n\r\nShould (3) be the only recommended method by upstream and vcpkg _some day in the future_? It feels tempting to deprecate (2) because one cannot rely on its availability in a generic case. And (1) is a bit incomplete and I'm not sure how easy it is to improve it. (Perhaps it could use pkg-config _if_ pkg-config is available?)\r\n\r\nIf (2) is valuable, I don't mind keeping it supported as the code already exists in `CMakeLists.txt`. The current state just might look a bit ambiguous to other developers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/comments/2167944273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-14T12:38:28Z","org":{"id":6154722,"login":"microsoft","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/microsoft","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?"}}
