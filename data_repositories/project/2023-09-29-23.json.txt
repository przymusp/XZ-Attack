Instead, `balancer/grpclb/state.Set()` should be used to add these addresses to the name resolver's output.  The built-in \"dns\" name resolver already does this.\n-   resolver: add new field `Endpoints` to `State` and deprecate `Addresses` ([#&#8203;6471](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6471))\n    -   `Addresses` will be deleted in the future.\n\n### New Features\n\n-   balancer/leastrequest: Add experimental support for least request LB policy and least request configured as a custom xDS policy ([#&#8203;6510](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6510), [#&#8203;6517](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6517))\n    -   Set `GRPC_EXPERIMENTAL_ENABLE_LEAST_REQUEST=true` to enable\n-   stats: Add an RPC event for blocking caused by the LB policy's picker ([#&#8203;6422](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6422))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n-   clusterresolver: fix deadlock when dns resolver responds inline with update or error at build time ([#&#8203;6563](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6563))\n-   grpc: fix a bug where the channel could erroneously report `TRANSIENT_FAILURE` when actually moving to `IDLE` ([#&#8203;6497](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6497))\n-   balancergroup: do not cache closed sub-balancers by default; affects `rls`, `weightedtarget` and `clustermanager` LB policies ([#&#8203;6523](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6523))\n-   client: fix a bug that prevented detection of RPC status in trailers-only RPC responses when using `ClientStream.Header()`, and prevented retry of the RPC ([#&#8203;6557](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6557))\n\n### Performance Improvements\n\n-   client & server: Add experimental `[With]SharedWriteBuffer` to improve performance by reducing allocations when sending RPC messages.
