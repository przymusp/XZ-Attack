While development of Asciidoctor 2.1 is beginning to pick up again, we extracted several other important improvements and bug fixes from main to include in this patch release.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The most critical fix in this release is to make Asciidoctor's logger compatible with the logger API in Ruby 3.3.<br>\nThe code is now tested against Ruby 3.3 on each change.<br>\nNearly as important, this release also turns off Ruby's system-dependent newline conversion when writing files so that Asciidoctor's output is consistent between *nix and Windows.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Numerous changes were made to correct AsciiDoc parsing. A nested dlist attached using a list continuation no longer consumes a detached paragraph. And an attached block is correctly attached to a nested dlist when that dlist is offset from its parent by an empty line. The secondary and tertiary terms on the <code class=\"notranslate\">indexterm</code> macro are preserved when the primary term is quoted and contains an equals sign. And a bare URL enclosed in angle brackets acts as unconstrained syntax that stops at the first occurrence of a closing angle bracket. When includes are not enabled, any spaces in the include target are preserved when generating the fallback link.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Several changes were made to the DocBook output to address compliance. The abstract is moved inside the <code class=\"notranslate\">&lt;info&gt;</code> tag (applies to both the abstract in the preamble as well an an abstract for a book part). The <code class=\"notranslate\">scaledwidth</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">scale</code> attributes are now supported on an inline macro, like with a block image macro.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">A few changes to the manpage output were made. Cells in the head row are styled as bold. Paragraph breaks in a normal table cell are preserved.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Finally, a few refinements to the default stylesheet were applied. The extra border below the doctitle when the sidebar toc is collapsed into main content area was removed. And a text decoration was added to the active footnote number link in the footnotes list.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Distribution</h2>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li><a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor\">RubyGem (asciidoctor)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Asciidoctor is also packaged for <a href=\"https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor\">Fedora</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/sid/asciidoctor\">Debian</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=asciidoctor\">Ubuntu</a>, <a href=\"https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=asciidoctor\">Alpine Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://software.opensuse.org/package/rubygem-asciidoctor\">OpenSUSE</a>, and <a href=\"https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/asciidoctor\">Homebrew</a>.

In the meantime, we extracted some of the minor improvements and bug fixes from main and put them into this patch release in the 2.0.x release line.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The most impactful fix is a switch from recursion to a while loop to prevent a stack limit error when looking for the next line to process. Those using JRuby will appreciate that fact that a <code class=\"notranslate\">uri:classloader:</code> prefix is treated as an absolute path rather than a URL, which will allow those paths to be read correctly and avoid misleading security warnings.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">A few refinements where made to how the AsciiDoc source is parsed. First, constrained passthroughs inside a monospace span are now always processed as expected. When parsing a dlist, a nested list that starts with at least one block attribute line is now attached correctly. The partintro block is now generated consistently, despite how it's defined in the AsciiDoc source. Numeric character references are passed over when searching for the URL fragment in the xref target. An inline ref is cataloged even if the resolved reftext is empty. An include target may not start or end with a space (to distinguish it from a dlist entry). Finally, square brackets are not swallowed when parsing an escaped URL macro.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Several improvements have been made when converting to man pages. When generating DocBook, the root <code class=\"notranslate\">&lt;reftext&gt;</code> tag is correctly enclosed in an <code class=\"notranslate\">&lt;article&gt;</code> tag and reftext substitutions are applied to the value of the <code class=\"notranslate\">mantitle</code> attribute. When converting to the man page format, the alt text of a block image is processed correctly (i.e., \"manified\"). In the HTML output, a monospace span in a section title is not converted to uppercase.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The default stylesheet has been updated so that the margin on the first and last child of a sidebar is collapsed correctly and so the font size of a term in a horizontal list matches the font size of a term in a regular dlist.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The code has been updated to be compatible with recent software releases, including Ruby 3.2, Haml 6, and Rouge 4.1.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Distribution</h2>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li><a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor\">RubyGem (asciidoctor)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Asciidoctor is also packaged for <a href=\"https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor\">Fedora</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/sid/asciidoctor\">Debian</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=asciidoctor\">Ubuntu</a>, <a href=\"https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=asciidoctor\">Alpine Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://software.opensuse.org/package/rubygem-asciidoctor\">OpenSUSE</a>, and <a href=\"https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/asciidoctor\">Homebrew</a>.

Speaking of misleading messages, the highlight.js integration has been updated so it isn't run on a source block that doesn't define a language (when the <code class=\"notranslate\">data-lang</code> attribute is absent) and thus doesn't issue a warning. If transcoding an attribute value passed via the CLI, the encoding is gracefully coerced to UTF-8. If extension code is malformed, the source location in the exception message is properly formatted.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Many of the other bug fixes and improvements came out of work on Asciidoctor Reducer. Those improvements include resetting the extension registry if activate is called on it again, prevent error if unregister is called on the registry before groups are initialized, format the source location in exception message when extension code is malformed, add the include role to the link macro that replaces the include directive when the include is not enabled, store an include path in the includes table of the document catalog with the value true if it is included both partially and full, propagate the <code class=\"notranslate\">:to_dir</code> option to the document for an AsciiDoc table cell, and fix the lineno on the reader when the skip-front-matter attribute is set but the end of the front matter is not found.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">As far as user-facing changes go, the default stylesheet has been updated to honor the marker style on a nested unordered list when a marker is defined on an ancestor list.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Distribution</h2>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li><a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor\">RubyGem (asciidoctor)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Asciidoctor is also packaged for <a href=\"https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor\">Fedora</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/sid/asciidoctor\">Debian</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=asciidoctor\">Ubuntu</a>, <a href=\"https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=asciidoctor\">Alpine Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://software.opensuse.org/package/rubygem-asciidoctor\">OpenSUSE</a>, and <a href=\"http://brewformulas.org/Asciidoctor\">Homebrew</a>.

Thus, this is a backport patch release. We also made numerous improvements to the documentation.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The most notable changes include fixing the display of the collapsible block in Safari (aligning the appearance with other browsers), getting the playlist attribute for YouTube videos working again, removing excess spacing around an empty list item, aligning the styles for the Rouge and Pygments default stylesheet, trimming the space after the line number in Pygments output, honoring stripes=none on nested tables, processing author and authors document attribute when implicit doctitle is absent, preventing line numbers on source blocks in HTML output from being selected, and removing the warning if a negated tag is not found in an include file (which is a valid scenario). For extension authors, Asciidoctor now ignores the return value of the process method for custom block or block macro if the value matches parent argument. You can also now return an AbstractBlock that's not itself a Block (such as a list or table). And thanks to an update to the open-uri-cached gem, the <code>cache-uri</code> attribute is now working on Ruby 3.1, and there are finally tests for that feature!</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Consult the CHANGELOG to find the full list of changes in this release.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Distributions</h2>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li><a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor\">RubyGem (asciidoctor)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Asciidoctor is also packaged for <a href=\"https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor\">Fedora</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/sid/asciidoctor\">Debian</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=asciidoctor\">Ubuntu</a>, <a href=\"https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=asciidoctor\">Alpine Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://software.opensuse.org/package/rubygem-asciidoctor\">OpenSUSE</a>, and <a href=\"http://brewformulas.org/Asciidoctor\">Homebrew</a>.

First, two regressions have been fixed when using negated wildcards in include tag filtering, and the meaning of negated wildcards in tag filtering has been clarified in general. Second, the source of the default stylesheet has been imported into this repository (now managed using a PostCSS build with autoprefixer and cssnano). Third, an internal change was made to how lines are iterated by the reader (switching from a stack to a queue), which will substantially improve the performance of Asciidoctor.js when processing large files. Finally, numerous improvements were made to the man page converter.</p>\n<p>This release also includes a handful of smaller bug fixes, including two scenarios where an undefined method error was creeping in. Several impactful updates were made to the documentation during this release cycle as well, most notably on the topic of generating man pages. An initial set of changes have been applied to the code base in preparation for enabling RuboCop to enforce a code style. The remainder of those changes, as well as the task itself, have already been applied to the default branch. Those updates will also be applied to the branch for this release line following this release. Speaking of release lines, the default branch is now open for 2.1.x development and beyond!</p>\n<p>Consult the CHANGELOG to find the full list of changes in this release.</p>\n<h2>Distributions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor\">RubyGem (asciidoctor)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Asciidoctor is also packaged for <a href=\"https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor\">Fedora</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/sid/asciidoctor\">Debian</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=asciidoctor\">Ubuntu</a>, <a href=\"https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=asciidoctor\">Alpine Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://software.opensuse.org/package/rubygem-asciidoctor\">OpenSUSE</a>, and <a href=\"http://brewformulas.org/Asciidoctor\">Homebrew</a>.

That hope that the previous release was the last one in the 2.0.x series before work begins on 2.1.x now extends to this release.</p>\n<p>The main issue this release fixes is to provide fallback xreftext for HTML output and the correct linkend value for DocBook output when an xref resolves to the current document and no link text is provided. This release also brings three minor fixes to how attrlists are parsed, though the impact of these changes is likely very small. While working on parsing, we discovered that trailing punctuation (., ?, and !) was getting included in the target URL of an autolink in certain cases. The trailing punctuation now stays outside of the link. In the manpage output, keyboard references are now formatted in monospace. Additionally, text formatting markup should now be interpreted more accurately.</p>\n<p>Consult the CHANGELOG to find the full list of changes in this release.</p>\n<h2>Distributions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor\">RubyGem (asciidoctor)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Asciidoctor is also packaged for <a href=\"https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor\">Fedora</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/sid/asciidoctor\">Debian</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=asciidoctor\">Ubuntu</a>, <a href=\"https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=asciidoctor\">Alpine Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://software.opensuse.org/package/rubygem-asciidoctor\">OpenSUSE</a>, and <a href=\"http://brewformulas.org/Asciidoctor\">Homebrew</a>.

It also provided the opportunity to fix a few additional bugs we uncovered while grooming the issue tracker. If all goes well, we expect this to be the last release of the 2.0.x series before work begins on 2.1.x.</p>\n<p>The main issue we discovered is that the <code>caption</code> attribute on a block was not being honored if the global <code>*-caption</code> attribute (e.g., <code>example-caption</code>) was unset. It turns out, this regression has been around ever since the Asciidoctor 2.0.0 release, but we only just discovered it. Now, the <code>caption</code> attribute on the block always wins out. We also discovered that, in certain cases, document attributes unset by the API could still be set in an AsciiDoc table cell. That loophole has been closed. Additionally, if a default attribute (like <code>table-caption</code>) is unset in the parent document, it remains unset in the AsciiDoc table cell. There are certain attributes which can be controlled independently by the AsciiDoc table cell. That list now includes showtitle/notitle. When fixing the security vulnerability in the counter attribute directive, we inadvertently broke counters when the attribute is locked. The counter now operates even when the attribute is locked.</p>\n<p>Consult the CHANGELOG to find the full list of changes in this release.</p>\n<p>During this release cycle, we finally got the Asciidoctor test suite running on JRuby for Windows for the first time.</p>\n<h2>Distributions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor\">RubyGem (asciidoctor)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Asciidoctor is also packaged for <a href=\"https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor\">Fedora</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/sid/asciidoctor\">Debian</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=asciidoctor\">Ubuntu</a>, <a href=\"https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=asciidoctor\">Alpine Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://software.opensuse.org/package/rubygem-asciidoctor\">OpenSUSE</a>, and <a href=\"http://brewformulas.org/Asciidoctor\">Homebrew</a>.

We strongly recommend upgrading to this version. This release will also be the candidate for making the switch to Asciidoctor 2 upgrade in Antora.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to fix the detection of a document header inside an include file, the processor was changed in 2.0.11 to remove leading and trailing empty lines in included AsciiDoc content. This turned out to be the wrong decision because it broke documents that relied on these empty lines to separate blocks. It also didn't fully address the problem. That change has been rolled back and the correct fix applied. We also discovered that it was possible to assign a value to an attribute locked by the API using the counter and counter2 attribute directives. This back door has been closed so that the locked state of the attribute is closed. The processor was also updated so non-ASCII characters used as the value of a counter attribute no longer cause the processor to crash. Thanks to a handful of reports filed by the community, we were able to substantially improve the man page output, including adding support for footnotes and page breaks, not mangling formatting macros when transforming section titles to uppercase, and substituting attribute references in the purpose part of the name section. Thanks to <a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/slonopotamus\">@slonopotamus</a>, the Pygments adapter was updated to support the pygments.rb 2 gem in addition to the pygments.rb 1 gem. You're encouraged to upgrade to pygments.rb 2 as it is both maintained and more stable. If you're using Rouge, thanks to <a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/Oblomov\">@Oblomov</a>, you should now find it easier to extend the built-in adapter to customize the lexer or formatter as the logic to instantiate them have been extracted so they can be overridden. Finally, to silence all log messages when using the API, you can pass the <code>logger: nil</code> option.</p>\n<p>Consult the CHANGELOG to find the full list of changes in this release.</p>\n<p>During this release cycle, the documentation for the Asciidoctor processor was imported into this repository and is published on the new <a href=\"https://docs.asciidoctor.org\">https://docs.asciidoctor.org</a> site powered by <a href=\"https://antora.org\">Antora</a>. Thanks to <a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/graphitefriction\">@graphitefriction</a> for her incredibly hard work to make that happen.</p>\n<p>Please note that it will not be possible to use Asciidoctor on Ruby &lt; 2.3 after the 2.0.x release line. Those versions are already unsupported. However, since we had not yet made a change that prevented them from working, we'll wait until 2.1.x to do so.</p>\n<h2>Distributions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor\">RubyGem (asciidoctor)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Asciidoctor is also packaged for <a href=\"https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor\">Fedora</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/sid/asciidoctor\">Debian</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=asciidoctor\">Ubuntu</a>, <a href=\"https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=asciidoctor\">Alpine Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://software.opensuse.org/package/rubygem-asciidoctor\">OpenSUSE</a>, and <a href=\"http://brewformulas.org/Asciidoctor\">Homebrew</a>.

While development of Asciidoctor 2.1 is beginning to pick up again, we extracted several other important improvements and bug fixes from main to include in this patch release.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The most critical fix in this release is to make Asciidoctor's logger compatible with the logger API in Ruby 3.3.<br>\nThe code is now tested against Ruby 3.3 on each change.<br>\nNearly as important, this release also turns off Ruby's system-dependent newline conversion when writing files so that Asciidoctor's output is consistent between *nix and Windows.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Numerous changes were made to correct AsciiDoc parsing. A nested dlist attached using a list continuation no longer consumes a detached paragraph. And an attached block is correctly attached to a nested dlist when that dlist is offset from its parent by an empty line. The secondary and tertiary terms on the <code class=\"notranslate\">indexterm</code> macro are preserved when the primary term is quoted and contains an equals sign. And a bare URL enclosed in angle brackets acts as unconstrained syntax that stops at the first occurrence of a closing angle bracket. When includes are not enabled, any spaces in the include target are preserved when generating the fallback link.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Several changes were made to the DocBook output to address compliance. The abstract is moved inside the <code class=\"notranslate\">&lt;info&gt;</code> tag (applies to both the abstract in the preamble as well an an abstract for a book part). The <code class=\"notranslate\">scaledwidth</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">scale</code> attributes are now supported on an inline macro, like with a block image macro.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">A few changes to the manpage output were made. Cells in the head row are styled as bold. Paragraph breaks in a normal table cell are preserved.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Finally, a few refinements to the default stylesheet were applied. The extra border below the doctitle when the sidebar toc is collapsed into main content area was removed. And a text decoration was added to the active footnote number link in the footnotes list.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Distribution</h2>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li><a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor\">RubyGem (asciidoctor)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Asciidoctor is also packaged for <a href=\"https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor\">Fedora</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/sid/asciidoctor\">Debian</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=asciidoctor\">Ubuntu</a>, <a href=\"https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=asciidoctor\">Alpine Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://software.opensuse.org/package/rubygem-asciidoctor\">OpenSUSE</a>, and <a href=\"https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/asciidoctor\">Homebrew</a>.

In the meantime, we extracted some of the minor improvements and bug fixes from main and put them into this patch release in the 2.0.x release line.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The most impactful fix is a switch from recursion to a while loop to prevent a stack limit error when looking for the next line to process. Those using JRuby will appreciate that fact that a <code class=\"notranslate\">uri:classloader:</code> prefix is treated as an absolute path rather than a URL, which will allow those paths to be read correctly and avoid misleading security warnings.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">A few refinements where made to how the AsciiDoc source is parsed. First, constrained passthroughs inside a monospace span are now always processed as expected. When parsing a dlist, a nested list that starts with at least one block attribute line is now attached correctly. The partintro block is now generated consistently, despite how it's defined in the AsciiDoc source. Numeric character references are passed over when searching for the URL fragment in the xref target. An inline ref is cataloged even if the resolved reftext is empty. An include target may not start or end with a space (to distinguish it from a dlist entry). Finally, square brackets are not swallowed when parsing an escaped URL macro.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Several improvements have been made when converting to man pages. When generating DocBook, the root <code class=\"notranslate\">&lt;reftext&gt;</code> tag is correctly enclosed in an <code class=\"notranslate\">&lt;article&gt;</code> tag and reftext substitutions are applied to the value of the <code class=\"notranslate\">mantitle</code> attribute. When converting to the man page format, the alt text of a block image is processed correctly (i.e., \"manified\"). In the HTML output, a monospace span in a section title is not converted to uppercase.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The default stylesheet has been updated so that the margin on the first and last child of a sidebar is collapsed correctly and so the font size of a term in a horizontal list matches the font size of a term in a regular dlist.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The code has been updated to be compatible with recent software releases, including Ruby 3.2, Haml 6, and Rouge 4.1.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Distribution</h2>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li><a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor\">RubyGem (asciidoctor)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Asciidoctor is also packaged for <a href=\"https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor\">Fedora</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/sid/asciidoctor\">Debian</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=asciidoctor\">Ubuntu</a>, <a href=\"https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=asciidoctor\">Alpine Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://software.opensuse.org/package/rubygem-asciidoctor\">OpenSUSE</a>, and <a href=\"https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/asciidoctor\">Homebrew</a>.

If transcoding an attribute value passed via the CLI, the encoding is gracefully coerced to UTF-8. If extension code is malformed, the source location in the exception message is properly formatted.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Many of the other bug fixes and improvements came out of work on Asciidoctor Reducer. Those improvements include resetting the extension registry if activate is called on it again, prevent error if unregister is called on the registry before groups are initialized, format the source location in exception message when extension code is malformed, add the include role to the link macro that replaces the include directive when the include is not enabled, store an include path in the includes table of the document catalog with the value true if it is included both partially and full, propagate the <code class=\"notranslate\">:to_dir</code> option to the document for an AsciiDoc table cell, and fix the lineno on the reader when the skip-front-matter attribute is set but the end of the front matter is not found.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">As far as user-facing changes go, the default stylesheet has been updated to honor the marker style on a nested unordered list when a marker is defined on an ancestor list.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Distribution</h2>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li><a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor\">RubyGem (asciidoctor)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Asciidoctor is also packaged for <a href=\"https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor\">Fedora</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/sid/asciidoctor\">Debian</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=asciidoctor\">Ubuntu</a>, <a href=\"https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=asciidoctor\">Alpine Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://software.opensuse.org/package/rubygem-asciidoctor\">OpenSUSE</a>, and <a href=\"http://brewformulas.org/Asciidoctor\">Homebrew</a>.

Thus, this is a backport patch release. We also made numerous improvements to the documentation.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The most notable changes include fixing the display of the collapsible block in Safari (aligning the appearance with other browsers), getting the playlist attribute for YouTube videos working again, removing excess spacing around an empty list item, aligning the styles for the Rouge and Pygments default stylesheet, trimming the space after the line number in Pygments output, honoring stripes=none on nested tables, processing author and authors document attribute when implicit doctitle is absent, preventing line numbers on source blocks in HTML output from being selected, and removing the warning if a negated tag is not found in an include file (which is a valid scenario). For extension authors, Asciidoctor now ignores the return value of the process method for custom block or block macro if the value matches parent argument. You can also now return an AbstractBlock that's not itself a Block (such as a list or table). And thanks to an update to the open-uri-cached gem, the <code>cache-uri</code> attribute is now working on Ruby 3.1, and there are finally tests for that feature!</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Consult the CHANGELOG to find the full list of changes in this release.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Distributions</h2>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li><a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor\">RubyGem (asciidoctor)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Asciidoctor is also packaged for <a href=\"https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor\">Fedora</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/sid/asciidoctor\">Debian</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=asciidoctor\">Ubuntu</a>, <a href=\"https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=asciidoctor\">Alpine Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://software.opensuse.org/package/rubygem-asciidoctor\">OpenSUSE</a>, and <a href=\"http://brewformulas.org/Asciidoctor\">Homebrew</a>.

First, two regressions have been fixed when using negated wildcards in include tag filtering, and the meaning of negated wildcards in tag filtering has been clarified in general. Second, the source of the default stylesheet has been imported into this repository (now managed using a PostCSS build with autoprefixer and cssnano). Third, an internal change was made to how lines are iterated by the reader (switching from a stack to a queue), which will substantially improve the performance of Asciidoctor.js when processing large files. Finally, numerous improvements were made to the man page converter.</p>\n<p>This release also includes a handful of smaller bug fixes, including two scenarios where an undefined method error was creeping in. Several impactful updates were made to the documentation during this release cycle as well, most notably on the topic of generating man pages. An initial set of changes have been applied to the code base in preparation for enabling RuboCop to enforce a code style. The remainder of those changes, as well as the task itself, have already been applied to the default branch. Those updates will also be applied to the branch for this release line following this release. Speaking of release lines, the default branch is now open for 2.1.x development and beyond!</p>\n<p>Consult the CHANGELOG to find the full list of changes in this release.</p>\n<h2>Distributions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor\">RubyGem (asciidoctor)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Asciidoctor is also packaged for <a href=\"https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor\">Fedora</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/sid/asciidoctor\">Debian</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=asciidoctor\">Ubuntu</a>, <a href=\"https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=asciidoctor\">Alpine Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://software.opensuse.org/package/rubygem-asciidoctor\">OpenSUSE</a>, and <a href=\"http://brewformulas.org/Asciidoctor\">Homebrew</a>.

That hope that the previous release was the last one in the 2.0.x series before work begins on 2.1.x now extends to this release.</p>\n<p>The main issue this release fixes is to provide fallback xreftext for HTML output and the correct linkend value for DocBook output when an xref resolves to the current document and no link text is provided. This release also brings three minor fixes to how attrlists are parsed, though the impact of these changes is likely very small. While working on parsing, we discovered that trailing punctuation (., ?, and !) was getting included in the target URL of an autolink in certain cases. The trailing punctuation now stays outside of the link. In the manpage output, keyboard references are now formatted in monospace.

It also provided the opportunity to fix a few additional bugs we uncovered while grooming the issue tracker. If all goes well, we expect this to be the last release of the 2.0.x series before work begins on 2.1.x.</p>\n<p>The main issue we discovered is that the <code>caption</code> attribute on a block was not being honored if the global <code>*-caption</code> attribute (e.g., <code>example-caption</code>) was unset. It turns out, this regression has been around ever since the Asciidoctor 2.0.0 release, but we only just discovered it. Now, the <code>caption</code> attribute on the block always wins out. We also discovered that, in certain cases, document attributes unset by the API could still be set in an AsciiDoc table cell. That loophole has been closed. Additionally, if a default attribute (like <code>table-caption</code>) is unset in the parent document, it remains unset in the AsciiDoc table cell. There are certain attributes which can be controlled independently by the AsciiDoc table cell. That list now includes showtitle/notitle. When fixing the security vulnerability in the counter attribute directive, we inadvertently broke counters when the attribute is locked. The counter now operates even when the attribute is locked.</p>\n<p>Consult the CHANGELOG to find the full list of changes in this release.</p>\n<p>During this release cycle, we finally got the Asciidoctor test suite running on JRuby for Windows for the first time.</p>\n<h2>Distributions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor\">RubyGem (asciidoctor)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Asciidoctor is also packaged for <a href=\"https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor\">Fedora</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/sid/asciidoctor\">Debian</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=asciidoctor\">Ubuntu</a>, <a href=\"https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=asciidoctor\">Alpine Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://software.opensuse.org/package/rubygem-asciidoctor\">OpenSUSE</a>, and <a href=\"http://brewformulas.org/Asciidoctor\">Homebrew</a>.

We strongly recommend upgrading to this version. This release will also be the candidate for making the switch to Asciidoctor 2 upgrade in Antora.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to fix the detection of a document header inside an include file, the processor was changed in 2.0.11 to remove leading and trailing empty lines in included AsciiDoc content. This turned out to be the wrong decision because it broke documents that relied on these empty lines to separate blocks. It also didn't fully address the problem. That change has been rolled back and the correct fix applied. We also discovered that it was possible to assign a value to an attribute locked by the API using the counter and counter2 attribute directives. This back door has been closed so that the locked state of the attribute is closed. The processor was also updated so non-ASCII characters used as the value of a counter attribute no longer cause the processor to crash. Thanks to a handful of reports filed by the community, we were able to substantially improve the man page output, including adding support for footnotes and page breaks, not mangling formatting macros when transforming section titles to uppercase, and substituting attribute references in the purpose part of the name section. Thanks to <a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/slonopotamus\">@slonopotamus</a>, the Pygments adapter was updated to support the pygments.rb 2 gem in addition to the pygments.rb 1 gem. You're encouraged to upgrade to pygments.rb 2 as it is both maintained and more stable. If you're using Rouge, thanks to <a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/Oblomov\">@Oblomov</a>, you should now find it easier to extend the built-in adapter to customize the lexer or formatter as the logic to instantiate them have been extracted so they can be overridden. Finally, to silence all log messages when using the API, you can pass the <code>logger: nil</code> option.</p>\n<p>Consult the CHANGELOG to find the full list of changes in this release.</p>\n<p>During this release cycle, the documentation for the Asciidoctor processor was imported into this repository and is published on the new <a href=\"https://docs.asciidoctor.org\">https://docs.asciidoctor.org</a> site powered by <a href=\"https://antora.org\">Antora</a>. Thanks to <a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/graphitefriction\">@graphitefriction</a> for her incredibly hard work to make that happen.</p>\n<p>Please note that it will not be possible to use Asciidoctor on Ruby &lt; 2.3 after the 2.0.x release line. Those versions are already unsupported. However, since we had not yet made a change that prevented them from working, we'll wait until 2.1.x to do so.</p>\n<h2>Distributions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor\">RubyGem (asciidoctor)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Asciidoctor is also packaged for <a href=\"https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor\">Fedora</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/sid/asciidoctor\">Debian</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=asciidoctor\">Ubuntu</a>, <a href=\"https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=asciidoctor\">Alpine Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://software.opensuse.org/package/rubygem-asciidoctor\">OpenSUSE</a>, and <a href=\"http://brewformulas.org/Asciidoctor\">Homebrew</a>.
