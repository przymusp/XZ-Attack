But the cat is out of the bag now and I see comments all over the place pinging the author. I think it's high time a bug report *here* notifies people following this tracker there is an issue. Also this serves as a request for a postmortem. Either this project has members that are bad actors or the members have themselves been deeply compromised. Most evidence seems to support the former.
