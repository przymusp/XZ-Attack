Without this flag, GNU windres passes command\narguments as-is to popen(), which means they get evaluated by a\nshell without being re-escaped for this case. To mimic this,\nllvm-windres has manually tried to unescape arguments.\n\nWhen GNU windres is given the --use-temp-file flag, it uses a\ndifferent API for invoking the preprocessor, and this API takes care\nof preserving special characters in the command line arguments.\nFor users of GNU windres, this means that by using --use-temp-file,\nthey don't need to do the (quite terrible) double escaping of\nquotes/spaces etc.\n\nThe xz project uses the --use-temp-file flag when invoking\nGNU windres, see\nhttps://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/6b117d3b1fe91eb26d533ab16a2e552f84148d47.\nHowever as llvm-windres didn't implement this flag and just\nassumed the GNU windres popen() behaviour, they had to use a\ndifferent codepath for llvm-windres.\n\nThat separate codepath for llvm-windres broke later when llvm-windres\ngot slightly more accurate unescaping of lone quotes in\n0f4c6b120f21d582ab7c5c4f2b2a475086c34938 /\nhttps://reviews.llvm.org/D146848 (fixing a discrepancy to GNU\nwindres as found in https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/57334),\nand this was reported in\nhttps://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw/issues/363.\n\nNot touching the implementation of the --preprocessor option\nwith respect to the --use-temp-file flag; that option is doubly\ntricky as GNU windres changed its behaviour in a backwards incompatible\nway recently (and llvm-windres currently matches the old behaviour).\n(See\nhttps://sourceware.org/git/?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=commitdiff;h=21c33bcbe36377abf01614fb1b9be439a3b6de20,\nhttps://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=27594 and\nhttps://sourceware.org/git/?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=commitdiff;h=5edb8e3f5ad8d74a83fc0df7f6e4514eed0aa77f;hp=3abbafc2aacc6706fea3e3e326e2f08d107c3672\nfor the behaviour change.)\n\nDifferential Revision: https://reviews.llvm.org/D159223\n\n(cherry picked from commit 2bcc0fdc58a220cb9921b47ec8a32c85f2511a47)","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apple/llvm-project/commits/466677b126855c79a05a1ebc111eea48053ad4ef"},{"sha":"ca372df48a05534d42130e6ecb4f6b275e003a08","author":{"email":"htsk30@gmail.com","name":"hstk30"},"message":"[AArch64] Fix arm neon vstx lane memVT size\n\nStN lane memory size set too big lead to alias analysis goes wrong.\n\nFixes https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/64696\n\nDifferential Revision: https://reviews.llvm.org/D158611\n\n(cherry picked from commit db8f6c009e5a17d304be7404e50eb20b2dd0c75b)","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apple/llvm-project/commits/ca372df48a05534d42130e6ecb4f6b275e003a08"},{"sha":"e04acab63c2682c690790111d688419158f15978","author":{"email":"i@maskray.me","name":"Fangrui Song"},"message":"[Driver] Report warnings for unclaimed TargetSpecific options for assembler input\n\nThis patch amends D151590 to not error for unlaimed TargetSpecific\noptions for `-x assembler` input files. This input type causes Driver to\nconstruct tools::ClangAs (-fintegrated-as) or other assemblers (e.g.\ntools::gnutools::Assembler) Their ConstructJobs methods, unlike\nClang::ConstructJobs, claim very few options. If an option is unclaimed,\nit either leads to a -Wunused-command-line-argument warning or an error\n(if `TargetSpecific` is set):\n```\n% clang '-###' --target=aarch64 -mbranch-protection=bti -c a.s\nclang: error: unsupported option '-mbranch-protection=' for target 'aarch64'\n```\n\nIt seems that downgrading the diagnostic to warning is most useful as\nmany users use CFLAGS even for `.s` files:\n```\nclang --target=aarch64 -mbranch-protection=bti -S a.c\nclang --target=aarch64 -mbranch-protection=bti -c a.s\n```\n\nI decide not to suppress the warning so that\n-Wunused-command-line-argument lovers still get a warning, and help\nprojects use proper ASFLAGS/CFLAGS/etc.\n\nNote: `-mbranch-protection=bti a.S` currently has no warning as `-x
