Currently such applications support just a preset level (integer 0-9). liblzma should have a string-to-filter-chain function. Then, for example, libarchive/bsdtar could let user specify a liblzma-specific string of compression options and pass that to liblzma as is.\r\n\r\nThe syntax to specify filter chains on the xz command line is likely a bit confusing. Using the above liblzma function in xz with  a new option would make the filter-chain specifications consistent between applications.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/issues/6/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/issues/6/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/issues/comments/1102745856","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/issues/6#issuecomment-1102745856","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/issues/6","id":1102745856,"node_id":"IC_kwDOGwGgMc5BupEA","user":{"login":"JiaT75","id":78042786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDQyNzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78042786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaT75","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-19T14:46:26Z","updated_at":"2022-04-19T14:46:26Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Branch ready in [filter_to_string](https://github.com/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/tree/filter_to_string)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/issues/comments/1102745856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-04-19T14:46:26Z"}
