While I admire and fond of good old plain ASCII text, but we also shouldn't let the chance of utilizing the modern Markdown features slip.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I've added the markdown only for README (old one's intact). If I get a green-light, I might also convert other ASCII plain text files into Markdown (while keeping the ASCII one's of course).\r\n\r\nI'm creating this PR as a draft, as only README is in Markdown and not every docs' file.\r\n\r\nAlso, best of luck.
