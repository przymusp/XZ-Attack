Any other information that is important to this PR. -->\r\nCMake build part is not provided as part of this PR.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes:\r\n* bumped checkout action to v3 (not really critical, but I did while trying to understand build failure)\r\n* fixed \"false positive\" uninitialized warning with empty in stream_encoder.c\r\n* fixed missing include in memcmplen.h, because this include is not provided if --disable-threads is requested for build\r\n\r\nWindows build run is very slow (comparing to others), but I don't think it could be somehow
