compiler has several issues that make it impossible to build liblzma:\r\n  - the compiler cannot handle unions that contain pointers that are not the first members (in some cases);\r\n  - the compiler cannot handle the assembler code in range_decoder.h (LZMA_RANGE_DECODER_CONFIG has to be set to zero);\r\n  - the compiler fails to produce valid code for delta_decode if the vectorization is enabled, which results in failed tests.\r\n\r\nThis introduces NVHPC-specific workarounds that address the issues.\r\n\r\n## Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been reviewed and added / updated if needed (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Build was run locally and without warnings or errors\r\n- [x] All previous and new tests pass\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request type\r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, renaming, typo fix)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [x] Other (please describe): workarounds for the compiler\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\nIt's not possible to build and get the tests pass with any existing release of the NVHPC compiler even when configuring as follows:\r\n```console\r\n$ ./configure --disable-symbol-versions CPPFLAGS='-DLZMA_RANGE_DECODER_CONFIG=0' CFLAGS='-O'\r\n```\r\n(`-O` is the same as the default `-O2` but without SIMD)\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nIt is possible to build and get the tests pass with any existing release of the NVHPC compiler when configuring as follows:\r\n```console\r\n$ ./configure --disable-symbol-versions\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nI don't
