Things look good to me now.\r\n\r\nIn case you handle the next release:\r\n\r\n* Be prepared to omit the `win_output_name.patch`.\r\n\r\n* Possibly check how `liblzma.pc` installation works with upstream `CMakeLists.txt` with MSVC. If it works then perhaps the `liblzma.pc` code in `portfile.cmake` can be cleaned up. However, such a cleanup isn't _mandatory_ because the portfile would just overwrite what `CMakeLists.txt` installs. So skipping the cleanup won't create new bugs.\r\n\r\nIf anything feels uncertain, feel free to ping me, although it's possible that I cannot help much with MSVC-specific issues.\r\n\r\n@BillyONeal:\r\n\r\n> Often we would be like 'Well taking the version update is more important than these improvements' I wanted to underline that we shouldn't do that this time.\r\n\r\nI spotted two new bugs that, once known, were very simple to fix. There was a chance that some vcpkg users could have hit those issues and even reported them to vcpkg. Then time would be wasted in figuring out what's wrong and getting them fixed. My understanding is that the whole point of PR reviews is to catch this kind of errors before they get merged.\r\n\r\nI agree that cleaning up the unneeded harmless patches isn't so essential. However, cleaning them up makes it easier to review the packaging as a whole and increases the probability that real issues are spotted in PR reviews. It took a while for me to notice the two actual problems because the unneeded patches added to the amount of things to review.\r\n\r\nIn any case it's not about making me happy. It's irrelevant who spotted the problems; they are worth fixing no matter who reports them. I know it can feel tedious for contributors but unfortunately packaging isn't just about bumping a version number if patches are being applied. Getting things fixed at upstream will make packager's job easier in the long run as fewer patches will be needed.\r\n\r\n@dg0yt:\r\n\r\nThanks for the explanations! I may look at `BUILD_TOOLS`-like feature in the future. The option naming in `CMakeLists.txt` is quite messy at the moment and I perhaps might wish to clean up those too. So these changes could perhaps be combined. We'll see.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/comments/2167784368/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-14T11:02:01Z","org":{"id":6154722,"login":"microsoft","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/microsoft","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?"}}
