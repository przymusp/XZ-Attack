Replace them with my signature on the same commits?\r\n\r\n2. Add a new commit (possibly even an empty one) to the v5.2 and v5.4 branches and sign that to indicate that I'm fine with the content?\r\n\r\n3. Do nothing?\r\n\r\n__What to do with the v5.6.x tags?__ Without the trigger code the backdoor files are harmless. However, I think it would be odd for me to sign those tags still. So I currently think I should leave them as is. I don't see a reason to delete the v5.6 branch.\r\n\r\n## Tarballs by Jia\r\n\r\n__Would a re-release of 5.2.12 and 5.4.6 be useful?__ Those likely are the last versions of the v5.2 and v5.4 branches.\r\n\r\nNew tarballs would be generated with newer Autotools and be signed by me. The filename would need to differ to avoid confusion. For example, xz-5.4.6-rerelease.tar.gz.\r\n\r\n__Should release files created by Jia be removed from official locations?__ Some of those I reviewed with `diff -Narup` against my release tarball candidates _back in the day_ (it was part of the process to teach him to do the packages well). I currently think it's unlikely that those contain anything bad. However, if those are kept available then the public will (rightfully) think that I have approved them even if I never signed them. Thus I would need to review the old packages to some extent in the near future.\r\n\r\n## Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nThis thread has wishes and suggestions around these questions already but not much explanation why those wishes are being made. Thus, I would like to hear a sentence or two why one choice is preferred over another.\r\n\r\nTo those without a GitHub account, replies via IRC or email are fine too.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2088735668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-01T16:34:56Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
