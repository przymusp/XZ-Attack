The main body text should be black (`#000`) when printing to avoid dithering.\r\n\r\nBrowsers might convert gray text to black when printing. Some printer drivers might do it too. So even now the gray text might print as black in some cases. It would be good to ensure good results in all cases still.\r\n\r\nFor example, Firefox 121 converts gray text to black if the gray color is specified as `#333` or `#666` and _Print backgrounds_ is unchecked in the Firefox' print options. However, if the same colors are specified as transparent black text like `rgb(0 0 0 / 0.8)` or `rgb(0 0 0 / 0.6)` then the text remains gray even if _Print backgrounds_ is unchecked. These can be tested by printing to PDF and taking a screenshot from a PDF viewer.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure which elements should use black text when printing. `h1`, `body`, `pre`, `code`, and the various table-related elements that use `rgb(0 0 0 / 0.8)` should probably be black when printing. But perhaps a few other elements should be black too.\r\n\r\n(A side note: I find `rgb(0 0 0 / 0.8)` (`#333`) too light on some displays (it hurts legibility). Somewhere from `rgb(0 0 0 / 0.87)` (`#222`) to `rgb(0 0 0 / 0.93)` (`#121212`) would look better to me. But I know it depends on the display, display brightness, user preference etc. so I don't dare to propose any changes.)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues/4531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues/4531/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-28T17:18:13Z","org":{"id":3137042,"login":"asciidoctor","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/asciidoctor","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3137042?"}}
