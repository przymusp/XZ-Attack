Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been reviewed

Feature\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\r\n\r\nOn LoongArch the generic table-based CRC32 implementation is

calculate the CRC32 result for 1/2/4/8 bytes in a single operation, making the use of LoongArch CRC32 instructions much faster compared to the general CRC32 algorithm.\r\n\r\nOptimized CRC32 will be

calculate the CRC32 result for 1/2/4/8 bytes in a single operation, making the use of LoongArch CRC32 instructions much faster compared to the general CRC32 algorithm.\r\n\r\nOptimized CRC32 will be

calculate the CRC32 result for 1/2/4/8 bytes in a single operation, making the use of LoongArch CRC32 instructions much faster compared to the general CRC32 algorithm.\r\n\r\nOptimized CRC32 will be
