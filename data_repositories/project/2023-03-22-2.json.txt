Extended attribute handling improved in Mksquashfs and Sqfstar\n\n    \t\t1.1.New -xattrs-exclude option to exclude extended attributes\n    \t\t    from files using a regular expression.\n    \t\t1.2 New -xattrs-include option to include extended attributes\n    \t\t    from files using a regular expression.\n    \t\t1.3 New -xattrs-add option to add extended attributes to files.\n    \t\t1.4 New Pseudo file xattr definition to add extended attributes\n    \t\t    to files.\n    \t\t1.5 New xattrs-add Action to add extended attributes to files\n    \t\t    (Mksquashfs only).\n\n    \t2. Extended attribute handling improved in Unsquashfs\n\n    \t\t2.1 New -xattrs-exclude option to exclude extended attributes\n    \t\t    from files using a regular expression.\n    \t\t2.2 New -xattrs-include option to include extended attributes\n    \t\t    from files using a regular expression.\n    \t\t2.3 Extended attributes are now supported in Pseudo file output.\n\n    \t3. Other major improvements\n\n    \t\t3.1 Unsquashfs can now output Pseudo files to standard out.\n    \t\t3.2 Mksquashfs can now input Pseudo files from standard in.\n    \t\t3.3 Squashfs filesystems can now be converted (different block\n    \t\t    size compression etc) without unpacking to an intermediate\n    \t\t    filesystem or mounting, by piping the output of Unsquashfs\n    \t\t    to Mksquashfs.\n    \t\t3.4 Pseudo files are now supported by Sqfstar.\n    \t\t3.5 \"Non-anchored\" excludes are now supported by Unsquashfs.\n\n    \t4. Mksquashfs minor improvements\n\n    \t\t4.1 A new -max-depth option has been added, which limits\n    \t\t    the depth Mksquashfs descends when creating the filesystem.\n    \t\t4.2 A new -mem-percent option which allows memory for caches to\n    \t\t    be specified as a percentage of physical RAM, rather than\t\n    \t\t    requiring an absolute value.\n    \t\t4.3 A new -percentage option added which rather than generating\n    \t\t    the full progress-bar instead outputs a percentage.  This\n    \t\t    can be used with dialog --gauge etc.\n    \t\t4.4 -mkfs-time, -all-time and -root-time options now take\n    \t\t    a human date string, in addition to the seconds since\n    \t\t    the epoch of 1970 00:00 UTC.  For example \"now\",\n    \t\t    \"last week\", \"Wed Mar 8 05:55:01 GMT 2023\" are supported.\n    \t\t4.5 -root-uid, -root-gid, -force-uid and -force-gid options now\n    \t\t     take a user/group name in addition to the integer uid/gid.\n    \t\t4.6 A new -mem-default option which displays default memory\n    \t\t    usage for caches in Mbytes.\n    \t\t4.7 A new -no-compression option which produces no compression,\n    \t\t    and it is a short-cut for -noI, -noD, -noF and -noX.\n    \t\t4.8 A new -pseudo-override option which makes pseudo file uids\n    \t\t    and gids override -all-root, -force-uid and -force-gid\n    \t\t    options.  Normally these options take precedence.\n\n    \t5. Unsquashfs minor improvements\n\n    \t\t5.1 New -all-time option which sets all file timestamps to\n    \t\t    <time>, rather than the time stored in the filesystem\n    \t\t    inode.  <time> can be an integer indicating seconds since\n    \t\t    the epoch (1970-01-01) or a human string value such as\n    \t\t    \"now\", \"last week\", or \"Wed Feb 15 21:02:39 GMT 2023\".\n    \t\t5.2 New -full-precision option which uses full precision when\n    \t\t    displaying times including seconds.  Use with -linfo, -lls,\n    \t\t    -lln and -llc options.\n    \t\t5.3 New -match option where Unsquashfs will abort if any\n    \t\t    extract file does not match on anything, and can not be\n    \t\t    resolved.\n    \t\t5.4 New -percentage option added which rather than generating\n    \t\t    the full progress-bar instead outputs a percentage.  This\n    \t\t    can be used with dialog --gauge etc.\n\n    \t6. Sqfstar minor improvements\n\n    \t\t6.1 A new -ignore-zeros option added which allows tar files to\n    \t\t    be concatenated together and fed to Sqfstar.  Normally a\n    \t\t    tarfile has two consecutive 512 byte blocks filled with\n    \t\t    zeros which means EOF and Sqfstar will stop reading after\n    \t\t    the first tar file on encountering them. This option makes\n    \t\t    Sqfstar ignore the zero filled blocks.\n    \t\t6.2 A new -mem-percent option which allows memory for caches to\n    \t\t    be specified as a percentage of physical RAM, rather than\t\n    \t\t    requiring an absolute value.\n    \t\t6.3 A new -percentage option added which rather than generating\n    \t\t    the full progress-bar instead outputs a percentage.  This\n    \t\t    can be used with dialog --gauge etc.\n    \t\t6.4 -mkfs-time, -all-time and -root-time options now take\n    \t\t    a human date string, in addition to the seconds since\n    \t\t    the epoch of 1970 00:00 UTC.  For example \"now\",\n    \t\t    \"last week\", \"Wed Mar 8 05:55:01 GMT 2023\" are supported.\n    \t\t6.5 -root-uid, -root-gid, -force-uid and -force-gid options now\n    \t\t     take a user/group name in addition to the integer uid/gid.\n    \t\t6.6 A new -mem-default option which displays default memory\n    \t\t    usage for caches in Mbytes.\n    \t\t6.7 A new -no-compression option which produces no compression,\n    \t\t    and it is a short-cut for -noI, -noD, -noF and -noX.\n    \t\t6.8 A new -pseudo-override option which makes pseudo file uids\n    \t\t    and gids override -all-root, -force-uid and -force-gid\n    \t\t    options.  Normally these options take precedence.\n    \t\t6.9 Do not abort if ZERO filled blocks indicating end of the\n    \t\t    TAR archive are missing.\n\n    \t7. Other minor improvements\n\n    \t\t7.1 If Mksquashfs/Unsquashfs fails to execute generating the\n    \t\t    manpages because they have been cross-compiled, fall back\n    \t\t    to using the pre-built manpages.\n    \t\t7.2 Add new Makefile configure option USE_PREBUILT_MANPAGES\n    \t\t    to always use pre-built manpages rather than generating\n    \t\t    them when \"make install\" is run.\n\n    \t8. Major bug fixes\n\n    \t\t8.1 Following a symlink in Sqfscat or where -follow-symlinks\n    \t\t    option is given with Unsquashfs, incorrectly triggered the\n    \t\t    corrupted filesystem loop detection code.\n    \t\t8.2 In Unsquashfs if a file was not writable it could not add\n    \t\t    extended attributes to it.\n    \t\t8.3 Sqfstar would incorrectly reject compressor specific\n    \t\t    options that have an argument.\n    \t\t8.4 Sqfstar would incorrectly strip pathname components in PAX\n    \t\t    header linkpath if symbolic.\n    \t\t8.5 Sqfstar -root-uid, -root-gid and -root-time options were\n    \t\t    documented but not implemented.\n    \t\t8.6 Mksquashfs -one-file-system option would not create empty\n    \t\t    mount point directory when filesystem boundary crossed.\n    \t\t8.7 Mksquashfs did not check the close() return result.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>protocolbuffers/protobuf-go</summary>\n\n### [`v1.30.0`](https://togithub.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go/releases/tag/v1.30.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go/compare/v1.29.1...v1.30.0)\n\n-   [Notable changes](#v1.30.0-notable-changes)\n\n**Announcement**\nIn the previous two releases, v1.29.0 and v1.29.1, we associated the tags with the wrong commits and thus the tags do not reference any commit in this repository. This tag, v1.30.0, refers to an existing commit again. Sorry for the inconvenience.\n\n#### Notable changes <a name=\"v1.30.0-notable-changes\"></a>\n\n**New Features**\n\n-   [CL/449576](https://go.dev/cl/449576): protoadapt: helper functions to convert v1 or v2 message to either v1 or v2 message.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>tukaani-project/xz</summary>\n\n### [`v5.4.2`](https://togithub.com/tukaani-project/xz/releases/tag/v5.4.2): 5.4.2 Stable\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/tukaani-project/xz/compare/v5.4.1...v5.4.2)\n\nThe Doxygen-generated liblzma API are now available online at\n<https://tukaani.org/xz/liblzma-api/files.html>.\n\n5.4.2 (2023-03-18)\n\n    * All fixes from 5.2.11 that were not included in 5.4.1.\n\n    * If xz is built with support for the Capsicum sandbox but running\n      in an environment that doesn't support Capsicum, xz now runs\n      normally without sandboxing instead of exiting with an error.\n\n    * liblzma:\n\n        - Documentation was updated to improve the style, consistency,\n          and completeness of the liblzma API headers.\n\n        - The Doxygen-generated HTML documentation for the liblzma API\n          header files is now included in the source release and is\n          installed as part of \"make install\". All JavaScript is\n          removed to simplify license compliance and to reduce the\n          install size.\n\n        - Fixed a minor bug in lzma_str_from_filters() that produced\n          too many filters in the output string instead of reporting\n          an error if the input array had more than four filters. This\n          bug did not affect xz.\n\n    * Build systems:\n\n        - autogen.sh now invokes the doxygen tool via the new wrapper\n          script doxygen/update-doxygen, unless the command line option\n          --no-doxygen is used.\n\n        - Added microlzma_encoder.c and microlzma_decoder.c to the\n          VS project files for Windows and to the CMake build. These\n          should have been included in 5.3.2alpha.\n\n    * Tests:\n\n        - Added a test to the CMake build that was forgotten in the\n          previous release.\n\n        - Added and refactored a few tests.\n\n    * Translations:\n\n        - Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation.\n\n        - Added Brazilian Portuguese man page translation.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 3am on Monday\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
