you @DavidKorczynski for the explanation and the advice for combining fuzzers. I had not thought of using a byte from the fuzz input to control the fuzzer's entry point.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, @mvatsyk-lsg we should combine `fuzz_encode_stream.c` and `fuzz_encode_stream_light.c` into just one fuzzer. We can use the same name `fuzz_encode_stream.c` for this fuzz target. We can use the first byte of input to help us determine the preset level. So the function could look like:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nextern int\r\nLLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *inbuf, size_t inbuf_size)\r\n{\r\n\tif (size == 0)\r\n\t\treturn 0;\r\n\r\n\tlzma_stream strm = LZMA_STREAM_INIT;\r\n\r\n\tuint32_t preset_level;\r\n\r\n\tuint8_t decider = inbuf[0];\r\n\r\n\tswitch (decider) {\r\n\tcase 0:\r\n\tcase 1:\r\n\tcase 5:\r\n\t\tpreset_level = decider;\r\n\t\tbreak;\r\n\tcase 6:\r\n\t\tpreset_level = 0 | LZMA_PRESET_EXTREME;\r\n\t\tbreak;\r\n\tcase 7:\r\n\t\tpreset_level = 3 | LZMA_PRESET_EXTREME;\r\n\t\tbreak;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tlzma_options_lzma opt_lzma;\r\n\tif (lzma_lzma_preset(&opt_lzma, preset_level)){\r\n\t\tfprintf(stderr, \"lzma_lzma_preset() failed\\n\");\r\n\t\tabort();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// Initialize filter chain for lzma_stream_decoder() call\r\n\t// Use single LZMA2 filter for encoding\r\n\tlzma_filter filters[2];\r\n\tfilters[0].id = LZMA_FILTER_LZMA2;\r\n\tfilters[0].options = &opt_lzma;\r\n\tfilters[1].id = LZMA_VLI_UNKNOWN;\r\n\r\n\t// Initialize the stream encoder using the above\r\n\t// filter chain and CRC64.\r\n\tif (lzma_stream_encoder(&strm,\r\n\t\t\tfilters, LZMA_CHECK_CRC64) != LZMA_OK) {\r\n\t\tfprintf(stderr, \"lzma_stream_encoder() failed\\n\");\r\n\t\tabort();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tfuzz_code(&strm, inbuf, inbuf_size);\r\n\r\n\t// Free the allocated memory.\r\n\tlzma_end(&strm);\r\n\treturn 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can test a few different dictionary sizes, match finders, nice length, modes, and depth levels with the same fuzzer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1840722453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-05T12:43:20Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
