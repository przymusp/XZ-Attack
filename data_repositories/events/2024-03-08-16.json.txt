When using Ruby 3.3, users would see a warning if this library is used, which happens when the data-uri attribute is set. The functionality has been replaced with a lower-level method on the String object (String#pack), which the base64 library delegates to anyway.</p>\n<p>This release also sets the cloaked-context attribute on a source block that is defined using either a styled paragraph or a literal or fenced code structural container. This matches the functionality used for custom block extensions (when the source context does not match the final parsed context).</p>\n<h2>Distribution</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor\">RubyGem (asciidoctor)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Asciidoctor is also packaged for <a href=\"https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rubygem-asciidoctor\">Fedora</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/sid/asciidoctor\">Debian</a>, <a href=\"https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=asciidoctor\">Ubuntu</a>, <a href=\"https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=asciidoctor\">Alpine Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://software.opensuse.org/package/rubygem-asciidoctor\">OpenSUSE</a>, and <a href=\"https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/asciidoctor\">Homebrew</a>.
