Actions referenced by tags and branches are more vulnerable to attacks, such as the tag being moved to a malicious commit or a malicious commit being pushed to the branch.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are pros and cons for each reference, GitHub understands [using commit SHAs is more reliable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/finding-and-customizing-actions#using-shas), as does [Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#pinned-dependencies) security tool.\r\n\r\nIf you agree, this would change, for example, `actions/checkout@v3` to `actions/checkout@f43a0e5ff2bd294095638e18286ca9a3d1956744` followed by a comment `# v3.6.0` to keep the version readable. Additionally, we can take this moment to bump `actions/checkout` to `v4` and other actions.\r\n\r\n### Expected Complications\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Will I try to implement this new feature?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n##### Additional Context\r\n\r\nHi! I'm Gabriela and I work on behalf of Google and the OpenSSF suggesting supply-chain security changes :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/65/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/65/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-10-17T16:53:45Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
