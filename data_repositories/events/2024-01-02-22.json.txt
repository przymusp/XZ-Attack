Cannot be combined with `--cold`.\r\n| `--sweet`   | Allow `cook` to make desserts. _{empty}_\r\n|===\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the first row, `cook` doesn't have the gray background. On the other two rows it has the background.\r\n\r\nIt happens because of this:\r\n\r\n```\r\np.tableblock > code:only-child {\r\n  background: none;\r\n  padding: 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get that it can make the first column in the table look better. The current implementation makes semantics and style mix a bit though because one may need to add an empty extra element to get the correct style when there is also non-monospace content in the table cell.\r\n\r\nIt's only a minor thing that is easy to work around once one is aware of it. The small details just grab one's attention when everything else looks very polished already. :-)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues/4535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues/4535/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-02T22:59:06Z","org":{"id":3137042,"login":"asciidoctor","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/asciidoctor","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3137042?"}}
