The \"supports\" clause reflects platforms that may be fixed by this new version.\n- [ ] Any fixed [CI baseline](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/scripts/ci.baseline.txt) entries are removed from that file.\n- [ ] Any patches that are no longer applied are deleted from the port's directory.\n- [X] The version database is fixed by rerunning `./vcpkg x-add-version --all` and committing the result.\n- [X] Only one version is added to each modified port's versions file.\n\nThis PR updates liblzma to the just-released version 5.6.2. I first copied the reverted port for 5.6.0, and updated versions.\n\nI also enabled the tools feature on Windows; the tools seem to run fine there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/39024/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/39024/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/comments/2166831179","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/pull/39024#issuecomment-2166831179","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/39024","id":2166831179,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBBJcqc6BJzhL","user":{"login":"BillyONeal","id":1544943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDQ5NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1544943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyONeal","html_url":"https://github.com/BillyONeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyONeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyONeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyONeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyONeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyONeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyONeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyONeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyONeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyONeal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-13T21:33:01Z","updated_at":"2024-06-13T21:33:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Note: @Larhzu is the maintainer of liblzma so we want to make sure they are happy.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/comments/2166831179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-13T21:33:02Z","org":{"id":6154722,"login":"microsoft","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/microsoft","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?"}}
