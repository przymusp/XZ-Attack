this appears to be the first test case making use of multiple filters.\r\n\r\nTerrain height data tends to have lots of periodic repeating patterns, so GeoTiffs compressed with GDAL's liblzma support tend to have lots of tiles that make use of delta filtering. I need a native rust implementation of lzma decompression for use in [OpenFA](https://openfa.org), so that I can port it to run on the web.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\n\r\nThis pull request was tested by...\r\n\r\n- [x] Added relevant end-to-end tests (an `.xz` file with a delta filter).\r\n- [x] Integrated into OpenFA's GeoTiff parser and demonstrated equivalent function to liblzma. \r\n- [x] Ran `cargo bench` to verify there were no performance regressions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Supporting Documentation and References\r\n\r\nCode for the delta filter was adapted from the C code in [xz-file-format.txt](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/blob/master/doc/xz-file-format.txt).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-02T02:45:23Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T17:58:57Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ae18446f04782b45239dbe134fbc5bb44fd4bfef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gendx/lzma-rs/pulls/101/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gendx/lzma-rs/pulls/101/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gendx/lzma-rs/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gendx/lzma-rs/issues/101/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gendx/lzma-rs/statuses/dd0e71b6bfa71ac718ad313bd87b2b6bcbe2344f","head":{"label":"terrence2:delta-filter-3","ref":"delta-filter-3","sha":"dd0e71b6bfa71ac718ad313bd87b2b6bcbe2344f","user":{"login":"terrence2","id":365237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTIzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/365237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2","html_url":"https://github.com/terrence2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":647817297,"node_id":"R_kgDOJpzoUQ","name":"lzma-rs","full_name":"terrence2/lzma-rs","private":false,"owner":{"login":"terrence2","id":365237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTIzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/365237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2","html_url":"https://github.com/terrence2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/terrence2/lzma-rs","description":"An

I need a native rust implementation of lzma decompression for use in [OpenFA](https://openfa.org), so that I can port it to run on the web.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\n\r\nThis pull request was tested by...\r\n\r\n- [x] Added relevant end-to-end tests (an `.xz` file with a delta filter).\r\n- [x] Integrated into OpenFA's GeoTiff parser and demonstrated equivalent function to liblzma. \r\n- [x] Ran `cargo bench` to verify there were no performance regressions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Supporting Documentation and References\r\n\r\nCode for the delta filter was adapted from the C code in [xz-file-format.txt](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/blob/master/doc/xz-file-format.txt).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-02T02:45:23Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T17:58:57Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ae18446f04782b45239dbe134fbc5bb44fd4bfef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gendx/lzma-rs/pulls/101/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gendx/lzma-rs/pulls/101/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gendx/lzma-rs/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gendx/lzma-rs/issues/101/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gendx/lzma-rs/statuses/dd0e71b6bfa71ac718ad313bd87b2b6bcbe2344f","head":{"label":"terrence2:delta-filter-3","ref":"delta-filter-3","sha":"dd0e71b6bfa71ac718ad313bd87b2b6bcbe2344f","user":{"login":"terrence2","id":365237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTIzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/365237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2","html_url":"https://github.com/terrence2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":647817297,"node_id":"R_kgDOJpzoUQ","name":"lzma-rs","full_name":"terrence2/lzma-rs","private":false,"owner":{"login":"terrence2","id":365237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTIzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/365237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2","html_url":"https://github.com/terrence2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/terrence2/lzma-rs","description":"An

I need a native rust implementation of lzma decompression for use in [OpenFA](https://openfa.org), so that I can port it to run on the web.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\n\r\nThis pull request was tested by...\r\n\r\n- [x] Added relevant end-to-end tests (an `.xz` file with a delta filter).\r\n- [x] Integrated into OpenFA's GeoTiff parser and demonstrated equivalent function to liblzma. \r\n- [x] Ran `cargo bench` to verify there were no performance regressions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Supporting Documentation and References\r\n\r\nCode for the delta filter was adapted from the C code in

I need a native rust implementation of lzma decompression for use in [OpenFA](https://openfa.org), so that I can port it to run on the web.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\n\r\nThis pull request was

Pull Request Overview\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds a delta compression filter and fixes multi-filter decompression; this appears to be the first test case making use of multiple filters.\r\n\r\nTerrain height data tends to have lots of periodic repeating patterns, so GeoTiffs compressed with GDAL's liblzma support tend to have lots of tiles that make use of delta filtering. I need a native rust implementation of lzma decompression for use in [OpenFA](https://openfa.org), so that I can port it to run on the web.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\n\r\nThis pull request was

I need a native rust implementation of lzma decompression for use in [OpenFA](https://openfa.org), so that I can port it to run on the web.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\n\r\nThis pull request was

I need a native rust implementation of lzma decompression for use in [OpenFA](https://openfa.org), so that I can port it to run on the web.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\n\r\nThis pull request was tested by...\r\n\r\n- [x] Added relevant end-to-end tests (an `.xz` file with a delta filter).\r\n- [x] Integrated into OpenFA's GeoTiff parser and demonstrated equivalent function to liblzma. \r\n- [x] Ran `cargo bench` to verify there were no performance regressions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Supporting Documentation and References\r\n\r\nCode for the delta filter was adapted from the C code in

I need a native rust implementation of lzma decompression for use in [OpenFA](https://openfa.org), so that I can port it to run on the web.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\n\r\nThis pull request was tested by...\r\n\r\n- [x] Added relevant end-to-end tests (an `.xz` file with a delta filter).\r\n- [x] Integrated into OpenFA's GeoTiff parser and demonstrated equivalent function to liblzma. \r\n- [x] Ran `cargo bench` to verify there were no performance regressions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Supporting Documentation and References\r\n\r\nCode for the delta filter was adapted from the C code in
