The calculation for file_size breaks down\ninto the sum of:\n\n- Compressed base from all previous Streams\n- 2 * LZMA_STREAM_HEADER_SIZE (size of the current Streams header and\n  footer)\n- stream_padding (can be set by lzma_index_stream_padding())\n- Compressed base from the current Stream\n- Unpadded size (parameter to lzma_index_append())\n\nThe sum of everything except for Unpadded size must be less than\nLZMA_VLI_MAX. This is guarenteed by overflow checks in the functions\nthat can set these values including lzma_index_stream_padding(),\nlzma_index_append(), and lzma_index_cat(). The maximum value for\nUnpadded size is enforced by lzma_index_append() to be less than or\nequal UNPADDED_SIZE_MAX.
