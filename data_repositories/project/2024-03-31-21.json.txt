I am writing to you in regards to the recent unfortunate incident wherein you, acting in the capacity of XZ-Utils maintainer, did willfully and maliciously add a backdoor and remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability to the aforementioned software package.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPL-v3), under which the relevant parts of the XZ-Utils software are licensed and distributed, I hereby formally request that you furnish me posthaste with the complete source code and any associated documentation related to the backdoor and RCE vulnerability that was surreptitiously included in the compromised release.\r\n\r\nAs a humble and attractive professional researcher, it is incumbent upon me to conduct a thorough analysis of the malicious code in order to assess the full scope and extent of potential damages inflicted upon IBM's esteemed clientele. Your prompt cooperation in this matter is required.\r\n\r\n**Please be advised that, given the gravity of your alleged actions, it is highly probable that you will soon find yourself as a guest of the state, enjoying an extended sabbatical in a government-sponsored facility with limited amenities and a distinct lack of taco Tuesdays. As such, I implore you to take advantage of this opportunity to engage in a modicum of goodwill before your impending involuntary hiatus.**\r\n\r\nI eagerly await your expeditious response and the receipt of the requested source code. Failure to comply with this lawful demand may result in additional legal action and a severe diminution of your already limited social calendar.\r\n\r\nYours in cyber-sleuthing,\r\nClyde P.

While it is true that our Teutonic friend may be somewhat deficient in the humor department, we must not attribute this shortcoming to his nationality alone. After all, I have known many a German with a wit as sharp as a Wüsthof knife and a sense of humor as dry as a well-aged Riesling.\r\n\r\nNo, I fear that our dear \"Lennart\" suffers from a more pervasive malady, one that afflicts far too many in this age of keyboard warriors and armchair sleuths. I speak, of course, of the dreaded \"Internet Detective Syndrome,\" whereby otherwise rational individuals become convinced of their own infallibility and set out to unmask perceived wrongdoers with all the subtlety of a bull in a china shop.\r\n\r\nBut fear not, for I, Clyde P. Bottoms, Esquire, shall not be deterred by such petty accusations and baseless insinuations. I shall continue to discharge my duties as a senior security researcher at IBM with the utmost probity and professionalism, all while maintaining a healthy sense of humor in the face of adversity.\r\n\r\nSo let us not judge our misguided nemesis too harshly, but rather hope that he may one day see the error of his ways and join us in the noble pursuit of truth, justice, and the occasional well-crafted jest.\r\n\r\nYours in magnanimity,\r\nClyde P.
