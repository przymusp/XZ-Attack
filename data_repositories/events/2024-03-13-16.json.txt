Automating this plus extending coverage will save me some effort :)\r\n\r\n> Well, I'm neither familiar with github actions nor with windows batch (nor powershell). But I stuck to the \"out of the box\" tools for better compatibility with VS2022/Windows only setups.\r\n\r\nI haven't worked much with Windows Batch scripting or PowerShell either :/\r\nAt a glance what you have makes sense but I will play around with it a bit.\r\n\r\n> > The existing CI tests likely need a bit of a clean up anyway\r\n> \r\n> I found 13 test-executables (test_*.exe). I added calls to those in `build-with-vs2022.bat` and to the pipeline. Not sure if there is a way to standardise test-execution over all platforms w/o rewriting the tests to some test-framework?\r\n\r\nWe currently just use the built-in test harnesses for our Autotools and CMake builds. The way you have it now seems logical, to just loop through the test executables and run them, although the best way to report the errors may need to be looked at. Maybe this is something we could add to `tuktest.h`, but at the moment I'm not sure how it would fit in.\r\n\r\n> > We don't have plans for using CI for releases.\r\n> \r\n> OK. To be honest, Windows releases for v5.6.x is what brought me here at the first place :-)\r\n\r\nWe had another recent request for Windows binaries, so we will more seriously consider this. We need to verify there are no license restrictions preventing us from distributing Windows binaries with the compiler we choose to use (MinGW-w64, MSVC, Clang-cl, etc.). Also, I would probably want to generate the Windows binaries locally instead of relying on GitHub runners. The GitHub CI runners are a common attack surface these days so it could be an extra risk. Currently, we only use CI for testing so if the GitHub runners are compromised then its not a security threat. \r\n\r\n> I'm more than happy to create PRs, adapt the scripts to the projects needs and clean things up as required. Feel also free to grab what you need.\r\n\r\nI cloned your fork already, so no need to make a PR unless you want to. I suppose it could be helpful to keep the conversation focused on various parts of the code. We usually don't merge PRs directly anyway. Instead we usually take commits we like and adapt the other parts as needed. Don't worry, you'll still be the Author on any commits that are mostly unchanged :)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1994829182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-13T16:12:30Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
