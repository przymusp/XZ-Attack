I need a native rust implementation of lzma decompression for use in [OpenFA](https://openfa.org), so that I can port it to run on the web.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\n\r\nThis pull request was tested by...\r\n\r\n- [x] Added relevant end-to-end tests (an `.xz` file with a delta filter).\r\n- [x] Integrated into OpenFA's GeoTiff parser and demonstrated equivalent function to liblzma. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Supporting Documentation and References\r\n\r\nCode for the delta filter was adapted from the C code in [xz-file-format.txt](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/blob/master/doc/xz-file-format.txt).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-02T02:45:23Z","updated_at":"2023-06-02T02:45:23Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gendx/lzma-rs/pulls/101/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gendx/lzma-rs/pulls/101/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gendx/lzma-rs/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gendx/lzma-rs/issues/101/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gendx/lzma-rs/statuses/dd0e71b6bfa71ac718ad313bd87b2b6bcbe2344f","head":{"label":"terrence2:delta-filter-3","ref":"delta-filter-3","sha":"dd0e71b6bfa71ac718ad313bd87b2b6bcbe2344f","user":{"login":"terrence2","id":365237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTIzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/365237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2","html_url":"https://github.com/terrence2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":647817297,"node_id":"R_kgDOJpzoUQ","name":"lzma-rs","full_name":"terrence2/lzma-rs","private":false,"owner":{"login":"terrence2","id":365237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTIzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/365237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2","html_url":"https://github.com/terrence2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrence2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/terrence2/lzma-rs","description":"An
