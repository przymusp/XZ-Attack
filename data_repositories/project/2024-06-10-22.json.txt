I guess that `win_output_name.patch` is an alternative to the upstream fix [Fix the import library filename](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/e67aaf698de75c73443a5ec786781cbf2034461d) that was included in 5.4.5 (and now 5.2.13 too). If the current upstream code isn't correct then it likely should be fixed.\r\n\r\nAs long as the name of the generated binaries matches between versions removing the patch seems OK to me.\r\n\r\n> portfile.cmake installs liblzma.pc. However, that was added to upstream CMakeLists.txt in [Generate and install liblzma.pc if not using MSVC](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/989c8c354cbd2d20fbae4a432a3e31f5bc1cb9bf) and included in 5.4.5. As the commit says, it's not enabled with Visual Studio. Should it be?\r\n\r\nI think it should. Deciding to provide .pc files is a build system concern unrelated to what compiler or host one is on. It's true that `pkg-config` is much less a defacto standard on Windows but that doesn't make .pcs harmful.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat said, the port still works with the patches as described here; is it OK if we take this version that built successfully and removing patches if necessary can be done in a followup?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/comments/2159437858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-10T22:48:44Z","org":{"id":6154722,"login":"microsoft","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/microsoft","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?"}}
