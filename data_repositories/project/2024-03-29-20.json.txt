While the intention behind these changes may have been to improve error reporting, there are concerns about potential security implications, especially in light of the recent discovery of a backdoor in the xz utility.\r\n\r\nUpon reviewing the changes, it appears that safe fprintf calls were replaced with unsafe fprintf calls in the error handling code. This alteration raises concerns about the possibility of introducing vulnerabilities, particularly if terminal escape sequences or other forms of exploitation are inadvertently included in error messages.\r\n\r\nGiven the sensitivity of the situation and the potential for similar vulnerabilities, I believe it's crucial for the project maintainers to thoroughly assess these changes and ensure that they do not inadvertently introduce security risks. Additionally, considering the recent backdoor discovery, it's important to prioritize the security and integrity of the xz utility.\r\n\r\nProposed Actions:\r\n\r\n    Revert the changes made to the error handling code, restoring the use of safe fprintf calls.\r\n    Use archive_errno instead of errno for error handling to mitigate potential risks associated with including terminal escape sequences in error messages.\r\n    Conduct a thorough review of the codebase to identify and address any other potential security concerns.\r\n\r\nAdditional Context:\r\n\r\n    Link to the relevant MR or commit where the changes were made.\r\n    Reference to any discussions or concerns raised by other contributors or community members.\r\n    Any other relevant information or insights that could aid in understanding the issue and its implications.\r\n\r\nRequest for Response:\r\nI kindly request a response from the project maintainers regarding these security concerns and proposed actions. Transparency and collaboration are essential in addressing potential security vulnerabilities and ensuring the continued trust and reliability of the xz utility.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\n### Version\n\n5.6.0/5.6.1\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/94/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/94/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2027684356","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/issues/94#issuecomment-2027684356","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/94","id":2027684356,"node_id":"IC_kwDOIQBEvs543AIE","user":{"login":"BillyONeal","id":1544943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDQ5NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1544943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyONeal","html_url":"https://github.com/BillyONeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyONeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyONeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyONeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyONeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyONeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyONeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyONeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyONeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyONeal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-29T20:02:32Z","updated_at":"2024-03-29T20:02:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> There is no commit in this repo that is malicious, but the tarballs that are being distributed in this repo are malicious.\r\n\r\nThis is not true.

But the cat is out of the bag now and I see comments all over the place pinging the author. I think it's high time a bug report *here* notifies people following this tracker there is an issue. Also this serves as a request for a postmortem. Either this project has members that are bad actors or the members have themselves been deeply compromised. Most evidence seems to support the former. If there is evidence of the latter I suggest getting it out there post-haste.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/92/reactions","total_count":75,"+1":56,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":7,"rocket":4,"eyes":8},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/92/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2027688761","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/issues/92#issuecomment-2027688761","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/92","id":2027688761,"node_id":"IC_kwDOIQBEvs543BM5","user":{"login":"capicy","id":148192382,"node_id":"U_kgDOCNU8fg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148192382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/capicy","html_url":"https://github.com/capicy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capicy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capicy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capicy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capicy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capicy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capicy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capicy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capicy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capicy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-29T20:07:08Z","updated_at":"2024-03-29T20:07:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> As the original email announcement has stated, only deb and rpm distros are targeted.\r\n\r\nYou can never be sure of the scope of things like this.

While the intention behind these changes may have been to improve error reporting, there are concerns about potential security implications, especially in light of the recent discovery of a backdoor in the xz utility.\r\n\r\nUpon reviewing the changes, it appears that safe fprintf calls were replaced with unsafe fprintf calls in the error handling code. This alteration raises concerns about the possibility of introducing vulnerabilities, particularly if terminal escape sequences or other forms of exploitation are inadvertently included in error messages.\r\n\r\nGiven the sensitivity of the situation and the potential for similar vulnerabilities, I believe it's crucial for the project maintainers to thoroughly assess these changes and ensure that they do not inadvertently introduce security risks. Additionally, considering the recent backdoor discovery, it's important to prioritize the security and integrity of the xz utility.\r\n\r\nProposed Actions:\r\n\r\n    Revert the changes made to the error handling code, restoring the use of safe fprintf calls.\r\n    Use archive_errno instead of errno for error handling to mitigate potential risks associated with including terminal escape sequences in error messages.\r\n    Conduct a thorough review of the codebase to identify and address any other potential security concerns.\r\n\r\nAdditional Context:\r\n\r\n    Link to the relevant MR or commit where the changes were made.\r\n    Reference to any discussions or concerns raised by other contributors or community members.\r\n    Any other relevant information or insights that could aid in understanding the issue and its implications.\r\n\r\nRequest for Response:\r\nI kindly request a response from the project maintainers regarding these security concerns and proposed actions.

While the intention behind these changes may have been to improve error reporting, there are concerns about potential security implications, especially in light of the recent discovery of a backdoor in the xz utility.\r\n\r\nUpon reviewing the changes, it appears that safe fprintf calls were replaced with unsafe fprintf calls in the error handling code. This alteration raises concerns about the possibility of introducing vulnerabilities, particularly if terminal escape sequences or other forms of exploitation are inadvertently included in error messages.\r\n\r\nGiven the sensitivity of the situation and the potential for similar vulnerabilities, I believe it's crucial for the project maintainers to thoroughly assess these changes and ensure that they do not inadvertently introduce security risks. Additionally, considering the recent backdoor discovery, it's important to prioritize the security and integrity of the xz utility.\r\n\r\nProposed Actions:\r\n\r\n    Revert the changes made to the error handling code, restoring the use of safe fprintf calls.\r\n    Use archive_errno instead of errno for error handling to mitigate potential risks associated with including terminal escape sequences in error messages.\r\n    Conduct a thorough review of the codebase to identify and address any other potential security concerns.\r\n\r\nAdditional Context:\r\n\r\n    Link to the relevant MR or commit where the changes were made.\r\n    Reference to any discussions or concerns raised by other contributors or community members.\r\n    Any other relevant information or insights that could aid in understanding the issue and its implications.\r\n\r\nRequest for Response:\r\nI kindly request a response from the project maintainers regarding these security concerns and proposed actions. Transparency and collaboration are essential in addressing potential security vulnerabilities and ensuring the continued trust and reliability of the xz utility.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\n### Version\n\n5.6.0/5.6.1\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/94/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/94/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2027691610","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/issues/94#issuecomment-2027691610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/94","id":2027691610,"node_id":"IC_kwDOIQBEvs543B5a","user":{"login":"mcatanzaro","id":1424966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjQ5NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1424966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcatanzaro","html_url":"https://github.com/mcatanzaro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcatanzaro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcatanzaro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcatanzaro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcatanzaro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcatanzaro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcatanzaro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcatanzaro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcatanzaro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcatanzaro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-29T20:10:41Z","updated_at":"2024-03-29T20:10:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/issues/92 already exists for discussing that issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2027691610/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-29T20:10:42Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}

Next level sneaky. I suppose even if it is guarded against in a 5.6.2 patch, there is now a point of entry and compromise whereby others will now try these sneaky tricks to backdoor or elevate privilege. I would think it will require more than XZ to be patched against this attack vector.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/comments/140384105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-29T20:12:40Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}

I didn't investigate the vulnerability in detail but with a quick look it seems the potential ramifications of this malicious actor's commit history are a bit larger than initially suspected, especially if `ssh` was affected just because of some connection to `libsystemd`, as quite a large % of my system's binaries depend on `liblzma.so.5`.\r\n> \r\n> https://gist.github.com/lietu/c9b3fc27642d59edb375edc3b4a16c72\r\n\r\nLmao, a good chunk of my system is going to need to be rebuilt.

Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been reviewed

type\r\n\r\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type, submit multiple\r\npull requests if needed. --> \r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\r\n\r\nOn LoongArch the generic table-based CRC32 implementation is used.\r\n\r\n<!-- Related issue this PR addresses, if applicable -->\r\nRelated Issue URL: None\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThe crc.w.{b/h/w/d}.w instructions in LoongArch can calculate the CRC32 result for 1/2/4/8 bytes in a single operation, making the use of LoongArch CRC32 instructions much faster compared to the general CRC32 algorithm.\r\n\r\nOptimized CRC32 will be enabled if the kernel declares the LoongArch CRC32 instructions supported via AT_HWCAP.\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking

calculate the CRC32 result for 1/2/4/8 bytes in a single operation, making the use of LoongArch CRC32 instructions much faster compared to the general CRC32 algorithm.\r\n\r\nOptimized CRC32 will be

type\r\n\r\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type, submit multiple\r\npull requests if needed. --> \r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\r\n\r\nOn LoongArch the generic table-based CRC32 implementation is used.\r\n\r\n<!-- Related issue this PR addresses, if applicable -->\r\nRelated Issue URL: None\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThe crc.w.{b/h/w/d}.w instructions in LoongArch can calculate the CRC32 result for 1/2/4/8 bytes in a single operation, making the use of LoongArch CRC32 instructions much faster compared to the general CRC32 algorithm.\r\n\r\nOptimized CRC32 will be
