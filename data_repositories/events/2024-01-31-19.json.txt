I was certainly very surprised to see that I was *accidentally* violating the GDPR. It was surprising that Asciidoctor by default uses Google Fonts.\r\n\r\nI think you should at least warn users about this. It is mentioned [here](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/html-backend/default-stylesheet/#web-fonts) but that is pretty deep in the docs and not highlighted. I would suggest a note on the command line like\r\n\r\n```\r\nNOTE: Using Google Fonts.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr failing that, a warning box on [this page](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/html-backend/).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could inline the fonts. WOFF2 fonts are very small (a few 10s of kB). That may be a better solution actually.
