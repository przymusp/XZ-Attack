Bottoms, Esq.\r\nIBM Senior Researcher\r\n\r\n\r\n> Oh, so you meant the source code for the _backdoor_. [Here](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4/1) it is, from the original email by Andres Freund on the oss-security mailing list. This is already public, and was de-obfuscated from the malicious 'test files'. As for any documentation on the exploit? Only time will tell. I don't even know how to reverse engineer a piece of malware, but if you are 'professionals of the highest caliber' then you should have the skills to analyse and reverse-engineer the code.\r\n> \r\n> TL;DR: Why should we spoon-feed you when you have a prime opportunity to test your skills?\r\n\r\nUpon reading your response, I was struck by the unmitigated audacity and sheer myopia you displayed in once again failing to comprehend the crux of my request. To reiterate for the umpteenth time: the source code I require is that which was deviously obfuscated within the malicious archives used to propagate the exploit, not the deobfuscated code that has already been shared on public forums. In addition, your patronizing suggestion that I should test my skills by reverse-engineering the malware is as asinine as it is insulting. Why would I waste my time doing this when I am within my legal right to request a copy as I am legally entitled under the GPL-v3? I can assure you that my skills are more than adequate to tackle any challenge that comes my way.\r\n\r\nYours in tenacious persistence,\r\nClyde P.
