A few were caused by bad\nadvice from me. Here is the summary of what is changed:\n\n- Author line edits\n\n- Small comment changes/additions\n\n- Using the return value in the error messages in the fuzz targets'\n  coder initialization code\n\n- Removed fuzz_encode_stream.options. This set a max length, which may\n  prevent some worthwhile code paths from being properly exercised.\n\n- Removed the max_len option from fuzz_decode_stream.options for the\n  same reason as fuzz_encode_stream. The alone decoder fuzz target still\n  has this restriction.\n\n- Altered the dictionary contents for fuzz_lzma.dict. Instead of keeping\n  the properties static and varying the dictionary size, the properties\n  are varied and the dictionary size is kept small. The dictionary size\n  doesn't have much impact on the code paths but the properties do.\n\nCloses: https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/73","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kiyolee/xz/commits/ee2f48350099201694a7586e41d7aa2f09fc74da"},{"sha":"4a972a8ee3ed88ac14067c1d2f15b78988e5dae8","author":{"email":"jiat0218@gmail.com","name":"Jia Tan"},"message":"Update THANKS.","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kiyolee/xz/commits/4a972a8ee3ed88ac14067c1d2f15b78988e5dae8"},{"sha":"a95a4c90b66383c38e39f58c5bac8b06869770ba","author":{"email":"kiyolee@gmail.com","name":"Kelvin Lee"},"message":"Import VS2022 solution and projects from xz-win-build","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kiyolee/xz/commits/a95a4c90b66383c38e39f58c5bac8b06869770ba"},{"sha":"98572bd6f549976ffd711f0091ef790f8b27b458","author":{"email":"kiyolee@gmail.com","name":"Kelvin Lee"},"message":"Import test scripts from xz-win-build","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kiyolee/xz/commits/98572bd6f549976ffd711f0091ef790f8b27b458"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-07T13:19:50Z"}
