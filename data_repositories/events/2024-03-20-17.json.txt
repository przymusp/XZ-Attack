This reduces compressed\nkernel size about 5 %. Previously such kernels were compressed using\nthe ARM filter which didn't do anything useful with ARM-Thumb2 code.\n\nAdd BCJ filter support for ARM64 and RISC-V. On ARM64 the compressed\nkernel size is reduced about 5 % and on RISC-V by 7-8 %. These require\nnew enough version of the xz tool. With an old xz version a message is\nprinted to standard error and compression is done without the filter.\n\nUpdate lib/decompress_unxz.c to match the changes to xz_wrap.sh.\n\nThanks to Jubin Zhong for pointing out that CONFIG_THUMB2_KERNEL\nshould be used to detect which BCJ filter is used on 32-bit ARM.\n\n    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1637379771-39449-1-git-send-email-zhongjubin@huawei.com/\n\nIt never got merged into Linux.
