However, lzma_str_to_filters() fails with \"lzma1\" when LZMA_STR_NO_VALIDATION. This is confusing because the \"validation\" is too vague. Checking if a filter can be used with the .xz format is technically validation. So, either the code should change or the documentation should be updated to clarify this.\n\n### Version\n\n5.4.1\n\n### Operating System\n\nUbuntu\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/24/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/24/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1404960566","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/issues/24#issuecomment-1404960566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/24","id":1404960566,"node_id":"IC_kwDOIQBEvs5Tvf82","user":{"login":"JiaT75","id":78042786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDQyNzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78042786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaT75","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-26T12:49:47Z","updated_at":"2023-01-26T12:49:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Created two PRs for this, but only one should be used.
