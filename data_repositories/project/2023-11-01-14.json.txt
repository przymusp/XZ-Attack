It uses 16-byte-aligned reads\n              which can extend past the bounds of the input buffer and\n              inherently trigger address sanitization errors. This isn't\n              a bug.\n\n            - Fixed an assertion failure that could be triggered by a large\n              unpadded_size argument. It was verified that there was no\n              other bug than the assertion failure.\n\n            - Fixed a bug that prevented building with Windows Vista\n              threading when __attribute__((__constructor__)) is not\n              supported.\n\n        * xz now properly handles special files such as \"con\" or \"nul\" on\n          Windows. Before this fix, the following wrote \"foo\" to the\n          console and deleted the input file \"con_xz\":\n\n              echo foo | xz > con_xz\n              xz --suffix=_xz --decompress con_xz\n\n        * Build systems:\n\n            - Allow builds with Windows win95 threading and small mode when\n              __attribute__((__constructor__)) is supported.\n\n            - Added a new line to liblzma.pc for MSYS2 (Windows):\n\n                  Cflags.private: -DLZMA_API_STATIC\n\n              When compiling code that will link against static liblzma,\n              the LZMA_API_STATIC macro needs to be defined on Windows.\n\n            - CMake specific changes:\n\n                * Fixed a bug that allowed CLOCK_MONOTONIC to be used even\n                  if the check for it failed.\n\n                * Fixed a bug where configuring CMake multiple times\n                  resulted in HAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME and HAVE_CLOCK_MONOTONIC\n                  not being set.\n\n                * Fixed the build with MinGW-w64-based Clang/LLVM 17.\n                  llvm-windres now has more accurate GNU windres emulation\n                  so the GNU windres workaround from 5.4.1 is needed with\n                  llvm-windres version 17 too.\n\n                * The import library on Windows is now properly named\n                  \"liblzma.dll.a\" instead of \"libliblzma.dll.a\"\n\n                * Fixed a bug causing the Ninja Generator to fail on\n                  UNIX-like systems. This bug was introduced in 5.4.0.\n\n                * Added a new option to disable CLMUL CRC64.\n\n                * A module-definition (.def) file is now created when\n                  building liblzma.dll with MinGW-w64.\n\n                * The pkg-config liblzma.pc file is now installed on all\n                  builds except when using MSVC on Windows.\n\n                * Added large file support by default for platforms that\n                  need it to handle files larger than 2 GiB. This includes\n                  MinGW-w64, even 64-bit builds.\n\n        * Small fixes and improvements to the tests.\n\n        * Updated translations: Chinese (simplified) and Esperanto.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nðŸ“… **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\nðŸš¦ **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\nâ™» **Rebasing**: Whenever PR becomes conflicted, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\nðŸ”• **Ignore**: Close this PR and you won't be reminded about this update again.\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n\n---\n\nThis PR has been generated by [Mend Renovate](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/).
