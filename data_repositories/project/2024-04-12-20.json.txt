Yes. But one could just add fresh backdoor files too, or copy the old ones from somewhere else. The other copies won't disappear even if 200 commits are rebased here.\r\n\r\nI agree that rebasing/filtering doesn't seem worth the cost.   However, it may be worth to remove the backdoored release tags and add them back under a different name, to avoid tooling from automatically using them.  I'd go for something like backdoored-vX.Y.Z, so they're clearly in a different namespace.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2052475987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-12T20:23:05Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
