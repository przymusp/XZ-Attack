Note that for it to work you practically need to keep the matching build tree around. Builds made with different options or builds of different package versions can install and thus uninstall a different set of files.\r\n\r\n`--prefix` sets the location where the files are expected to be when the programs or libraries are used. This matters because some paths may get hardcoded (like translations or library search path (rpath)).\r\n\r\n`DESTDIR` allows doing a kind of fake install to a temporary directory from which a distro-specific package (`.deb`, `.rpm`, `.txz` etc.) can be created. In general one cannot run the program in the `DESTDIR` directory.\r\n\r\nOne option is to use\r\n\r\n```\r\n./configure --prefix=/home/foo/local-xz\r\nmake install\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then put /home/foo/local-xz/bin to `PATH`. This way uninstallation is simple: just `rm -r /home/foo/local-xz`.\r\n\r\nIn case of XZ Utils, if you only want the latest `xz` command line tool, build it against static liblzma without translation support. In case of `xz` there will then be no dependencies that rely on `--prefix`. With many other packages it's not so; this tip is specific to XZ Utils. You can also use the `-j` option with `make` to use multiple processor cores for a shorter build time.\r\n\r\n```\r\n./configure --disable-shared --disable-nls\r\nmake -j4\r\ncp src/xz/xz /home/foo/bin/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `/home/foo/bin/` is a directory of your choosing. That is, no need to use `make install` if you only need `xz`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1814455227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-11-16T13:39:53Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
