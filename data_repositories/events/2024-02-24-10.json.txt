(2024-02-24)\r\n\r\n    This bumps the minor version of liblzma because new features were\r\n    added. The API and ABI are still backward compatible with liblzma\r\n    5.4.x and 5.2.x and 5.0.x.\r\n\r\n    NOTE: As described in the NEWS for 5.5.2beta, the core components\r\n    are now under the BSD Zero Clause License (0BSD).\r\n\r\n    Since 5.5.2beta:\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - Disabled the branchless C variant in the LZMA decoder based\r\n          on the benchmark results from the community.\r\n\r\n        - Disabled x86-64 inline assembly on x32 to fix the build.\r\n\r\n    * Sandboxing support in xz:\r\n\r\n        - Landlock is now used even when xz needs to create files.\r\n          In this case the sandbox is has to be more permissive than\r\n          when no files need to be created. A similar thing was\r\n          already in use with pledge(2) since 5.3.4alpha.\r\n\r\n        - Landlock and pledge(2) are now stricter when reading from\r\n          more than one input file and only writing to standard output.\r\n\r\n        - Added support for Landlock ABI version 4.\r\n\r\n    * CMake:\r\n\r\n        - Default to -O2 instead of -O3 with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release.\r\n          -O3 is not useful for speed and makes the code larger.\r\n\r\n        - Now builds lzmainfo and lzmadec.\r\n\r\n        - xzdiff, xzgrep, xzless, xzmore, and their symlinks are now\r\n          installed. The scripts are also tested during \"make test\".\r\n\r\n        - Added translation support for xz, lzmainfo, and the\r\n          man pages.\r\n\r\n        - Applied the symbol versioning workaround for MicroBlaze that\r\n          is used in the Autotools build.\r\n\r\n        - The general XZ Utils and liblzma API documentation is now\r\n          installed.\r\n\r\n        - The CMake component names were changed a little and several\r\n          were added. liblzma_Runtime and liblzma_Development are\r\n          unchanged.\r\n\r\n        - Minimum required CMake version is now 3.14. However,\r\n          translation support is disabled with CMake versions\r\n          older than 3.20.\r\n\r\n        - The CMake-based build is now close to feature parity with the\r\n          Autotools-based build. Most importantly a few tests aren't\r\n          run yet. Testing the CMake-based build on different operating\r\n          systems would be welcome now. See the comment at the top of\r\n          CMakeLists.txt.\r\n\r\n    * Fixed a bug in the Autotools feature test for ARM64 CRC32\r\n      instruction support for old versions of Clang. This did not\r\n      affect the CMake build.\r\n\r\n    * Windows:\r\n\r\n        - The build instructions in INSTALL and windows/INSTALL*.txt\r\n          were revised completely.\r\n\r\n        - windows/build-with-cmake.bat along with the instructions\r\n          in windows/INSTALL-MinGW-w64_with_CMake.txt should make\r\n          it very easy to build liblzma.dll and xz.exe on Windows\r\n          using CMake and MinGW-w64 with either GCC or Clang/LLVM.\r\n\r\n        - windows/build.bash was updated. It now works on MSYS2 and\r\n          on GNU/Linux (cross-compiling) to create a .zip and .7z\r\n          package for 32-bit and 64-bit x86 using GCC + MinGW-w64.\r\n\r\n    * The TODO file is no longer installed as part of the\r\n      documentation. The file is out of date and does not reflect\r\n      the actual tasks that will be completed in the future.\r\n\r\n    * Translations:\r\n\r\n        - Translated lzmainfo man pages are now installed. These\r\n          had been forgotten in earlier versions.\r\n\r\n        - Updated Croatian, Esperanto, German, Hungarian, Korean,\r\n          Polish, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Vietnamese, and Ukrainian\r\n          translations.\r\n\r\n        - Updated German, Korean, Romanian, and Ukrainian man page\r\n          translations.\r\n\r\n    * Added a few tests.\r\n   ```","short_description_html":"<p>There currently are no plans to maintain the 5.4.x branch, but releases<br>\ncould be made if there is community interest.</p>\n<p>Here is an extract from the NEWS file:</p>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"5.6.0 (2024-02-24)\n\n    This bumps the minor version of liblzma because new features were\n    added.

Most importantly a few tests aren't\n          run yet. Testing the CMake-based build on different operating\n          systems would be welcome now. See the comment at the top of\n          CMakeLists.txt.\n\n    * Fixed a bug in the Autotools feature test for ARM64 CRC32\n      instruction support for old versions of Clang. This did not\n      affect the CMake build.\n\n    * Windows:\n\n        - The build instructions in INSTALL and windows/INSTALL*.txt\n          were revised completely.\n\n        - windows/build-with-cmake.bat along with the instructions\n          in windows/INSTALL-MinGW-w64_with_CMake.txt should make\n          it very easy to build liblzma.dll and xz.exe on Windows\n          using CMake and MinGW-w64 with either GCC or Clang/LLVM.\n\n        - windows/build.bash was updated. It now works on MSYS2 and\n          on GNU/Linux (cross-compiling) to create a .zip and .7z\n          package for 32-bit and 64-bit x86 using GCC + MinGW-w64.\n\n    * The TODO file is no longer installed as part of the\n      documentation. The file is out of date and does not reflect\n      the actual tasks that will be completed in the future.\n\n    * Translations:\n\n        - Translated lzmainfo man pages are now installed. These\n          had been forgotten in earlier versions.\n\n        - Updated Croatian, Esperanto, German, Hungarian, Korean,\n          Polish, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Vietnamese, and Ukrainian\n          translations.\n\n        - Updated German, Korean, Romanian, and Ukrainian man page\n          translations.\n\n    * Added a few tests.\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><code>5.6.0 (2024-02-24)\n\n    This bumps the m…</code></pre></div>","is_short_description_html_truncated":true}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-24T10:04:07Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
