the compiler cannot handle unions that contain pointers that are not the first members (in some cases);\r\n  - the compiler cannot handle the assembler code in range_decoder.h (LZMA_RANGE_DECODER_CONFIG has to be set to zero);\r\n  - the compiler fails to produce valid code for delta_decode if the vectorization is enabled, which results in failed tests.\r\n\r\nThis introduces NVHPC-specific workarounds that address the issues.\r\n\r\n## Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been reviewed and added / updated if needed (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Build was run locally and without warnings or errors\r\n- [x] All previous and new tests pass\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request type\r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, renaming, typo fix)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [x] Other (please describe): workarounds for the compiler\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\nIt's not possible to build and get the tests pass with any existing release of the NVHPC compiler even when configuring as follows:\r\n```console\r\n$ ./configure --disable-symbol-versions CPPFLAGS='-DLZMA_RANGE_DECODER_CONFIG=0' CFLAGS='-O'\r\n```\r\n(`-O` is the same as the default `-O2` but without SIMD)\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nIt is possible to build and get the tests pass with any existing release of the NVHPC compiler when configuring as follows:\r\n```console\r\n$ ./configure --disable-symbol-versions\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nI don't know if there is any interest in supporting NVHPC and I'd understand if there's none.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/91/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/91/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1994565554","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/91#issuecomment-1994565554","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/91","id":1994565554,"node_id":"IC_kwDOIQBEvs524qey","user":{"login":"JiaT75","id":78042786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDQyNzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78042786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaT75","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-13T14:44:49Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T14:44:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hello!
