Currently such applications support just a preset level (integer 0-9). liblzma should have a string-to-filter-chain function. Then, for example, libarchive/bsdtar could let user specify a liblzma-specific string of compression options and pass that to liblzma as is.\r\n\r\nThe syntax to specify filter chains on the xz command line is likely a bit confusing. Using the above liblzma function in xz with  a new option would make the filter-chain specifications consistent between applications.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/issues/6/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JiaT75/XZ_Utils_Unofficial/issues/6/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-12-01T17:14:58Z"}
