Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been reviewed

Feature\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\r\n\r\nOn LoongArch the generic table-based CRC32 implementation is

calculate the CRC32 result for 1/2/4/8 bytes in a single operation, making the use of LoongArch CRC32 instructions much faster compared to the general CRC32 algorithm.\r\n\r\nOptimized CRC32 will be enabled if the kernel declares the LoongArch CRC32 instructions supported via AT_HWCAP.\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking

But the cat is out of the bag now and I see comments all over the place pinging the author. I think it's high time a bug report *here* notifies people following this tracker there is an issue. Also this serves as a request for a postmortem. Either this project has members that are bad actors or the members have themselves been deeply compromised. Most evidence seems to support the former. If there is evidence of the latter I suggest getting it out there post-haste.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/92/reactions","total_count":107,"+1":80,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":8,"rocket":6,"eyes":13},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/92/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2027750326","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/issues/92#issuecomment-2027750326","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/92","id":2027750326,"node_id":"IC_kwDOIQBEvs543QO2","user":{"login":"broukema","id":24659560,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjU5NTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24659560?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/broukema","html_url":"https://github.com/broukema","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/broukema/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/broukema/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/broukema/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/broukema/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/broukema/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/broukema/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/broukema/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/broukema/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/broukema/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-29T21:24:19Z","updated_at":"2024-03-29T21:24:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"There is a live FAQ on this issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/thesamesam/223949d5a074ebc3dce9ee78baad9e27\r\n\r\nAnd to quote from the current version of the `People` part:\r\n\r\n````\r\nPeople\r\n\r\nWe do not want to speculate on the people behind this project in this document.\r\nThis is not a productive use of our time, and law enforcement will be able to handle identifying those responsible.\r\nThey are likely patching their systems too.\r\n\r\nxz-utils has two maintainers:\r\n\r\n    Lasse Collin (Larzhu) who has maintained xz since the beginning (~2009), and before that, lzma-utils.\r\n    Jia Tan (JiaT75) who started contributing to xz in the last 2-2.5 years and gained commit access,\r\n    and then release manager rights, about 1.5 years ago.\r\n\r\nLasse regularly has internet breaks and is on one at the moment, started before this all kicked off.\r\nWe believe CISA may be trying to get in contact with him.\r\n````","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2027750326/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-29T21:24:20Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}

This whole project needs an audit from a reasonably-trusted 3rd-party.\r\n\r\n@github This repo in distributing malware, it should probably be frozen until a full investigation is performed.\r\n\r\nI tried to look into Jia Tan some, but I couldn't find *any* information about them as a person.  Their first commit to xz was early 2022 with https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/6468f7e41a8e9c611e4ba8d34e2175c5dacdbeb4.  What's weird is that it was a direct commit, not a PR or such, though it does say that it was authored by @JiaT75 but committed by @Larhzu.  In fact, all commits are like this up until https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/8ace358d65059152d9a1f43f4770170d29d35754, which is authored and committed by @JiaT75 via https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/2.\r\n\r\nMy first thought based on the name was the CCP sticking their hands in things they shouldn't, but given that I couldn't find *any* info on them as a person, now I'm just left with more questions.  Is Jia Tan even a real person?  Was this a long-play by some state actor?  If so, who?  Or was this just one person going rouge with no connections to groups or states, but if that's the case, then why did they do this?  Was this always the goal, or did something change?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/comments/140386085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-29T21:53:03Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
