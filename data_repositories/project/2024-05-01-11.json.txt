Thanks!\r\n\r\nI'm not very familiar with the GitHub workflows files. Running spellcheck automatically could make sense, on the other hand it's easy to run it manually every once in a while.\r\n\r\nI gave up with spellcheckers a very long time ago as the false positives were too annoying. I know I've made quite a few spelling errors over the years though and other people have sent fixes. So I might run codespell now and then in the future.\r\n\r\nNote that I'm not able to reopen this PR as GitHub suspended most forks the xz repository.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2088292084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-01T11:01:08Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}

With more typical security issues it seems sensible to try to prepare a fix first so that fewer bad actors will have time to use the information. So one has to use some common sense when one finds a security issue.\r\n\r\nI assume that people are capable of providing the required information without detailed handholding in a form of a bullet point list. I asked Jia to simplify the file and also the issue and PR templates and I don't want to restore such cruft. If something is missing from a report, it's possible to ask for more information.\r\n\r\nIt seems that `SECURITY.md` still keeps attracting posts and this makes me wonder if the existence of that file really does more good than bad. People had no trouble reporting issues via email before the project was on GitHub. (Or maybe email should be the only method listed in `SECURITY.md` as it's simpler than the GH feature.)\r\n\r\nFor example, CVE-2022-1271 (ZDI-CAN-16587) was reported to me and then I reported it to GNU gzip maintainers since the bug was inherited to `xzgrep` from `zgrep`. It took several emails to polish the fix and coordinate the disclosure with xz, gzip, and downstream distros (distros via mailing list on openwall.com). I think the process worked really well.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2088307285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-01T11:18:56Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
