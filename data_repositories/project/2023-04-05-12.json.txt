This seems like a great idea, thanks for the suggestion. At the moment, users are expected to report security reports to our project's email address (xz@tukaani.org). Since we moved to GitHub, it is probably less clear that is our expectation, especially for users who find the project through GitHub. So setting up a SECURITY.md file will be helpful.\r\n\r\nYou are welcome to suggest an initial version for the Security Policy through a PR.
