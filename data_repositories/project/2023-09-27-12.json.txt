It looks like Windows CI is broken on the master branch, so thanks for letting us know. I have it set it up to only run manually because it runs much slower than Ubuntu and Mac OS runners. I suppose I should manually run it more often.\r\n\r\nWe have been doing a few Windows related changes for xz recently so thats likely what broke it. I will investigate the issue and let you know when  it is fixed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1737294180/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-27T12:28:00Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
