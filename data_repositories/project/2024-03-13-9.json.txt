thanks for the report 🙇 \n\nThe Action uses [ClearlyDefined](https://clearlydefined.io/) to fetch project licenses. I took a quick look at these two projects:\n\n1. `aopalliance:aopalliance`: This was last updated in 2015, I could not find the `LICENSE` file in an online repo. ClearlyDefined reported [this as \"OTHER\" in this PR](https://github.com/clearlydefined/curated-data/pull/2599).\n\n2. `org.tukaani/xz`: the ClearlyDefined license is [also OTHER](https://clearlydefined.io/definitions/maven/mavencentral/org.tukaani/xz/1.9). I took a look at [their repo](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz-java/) and they are using a `0BSD` license, which I think should be renamed to `ISC` to be made SPDX-compliant (need a double check here).\n\nFor a quick fix, you can add an `allow-dependencies-licenses` option to your configuration, and add entries in PURL format. With that the Action should skip the licenses check.\n\nFor a long-term fix I'd encourage you to open a pull request in https://github.com/clearlydefined/curated-data/ to update the licenses for both of these projects in ClearlyDefined.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actions/dependency-review-action/issues/comments/1993879365/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-13T09:09:59Z","org":{"id":44036562,"login":"actions","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/actions","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44036562?"}}
