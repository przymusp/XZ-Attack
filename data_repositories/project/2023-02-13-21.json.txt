Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [X] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been reviewed and added / updated if needed (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Build was run locally and without warnings or errors\r\n- [X] All previous and new tests pass\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request type\r\n\r\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type, submit multiple\r\npull requests if needed. --> \r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, renaming, typo fix)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [X] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content

Related issue this PR addresses, if applicable -->\r\nRelated Issue URL: https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/issues/18\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by this\r\nPR. -->\r\n\r\n- autotools build set for Windows added\r\n- build is using msys2 with UCRT64 toolchain\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and\r\nmigration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR. -->\r\nCMake build part is not provided as part of this PR.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes:\r\n* bumped checkout action to v3 (not really critical, but I did while trying to understand build failure)\r\n* fixed \"false positive\" uninitialized warning with empty in stream_encoder.c\r\n* fixed missing include in memcmplen.h, because this include is not provided if --disable-threads is requested for build\r\n\r\nWindows build run is very slow (comparing to others), but I don't think it could be somehow improved.","created_at":"2023-02-12T22:06:00Z","updated_at":"2023-02-13T21:53:59Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"80882bb18c905e885e25baa45b0d877cf333f775","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5149656179,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIQBEvs8AAAABMvGEcw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/labels/CI/CD","name":"CI/CD","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"Improvements
