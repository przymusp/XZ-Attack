an implementation for crc32 that makes use of clmul.\r\nCode for this implementation was written by Ilya Kurdyukov and can be found here.\r\nhttps://github.com/ilyakurdyukov/crc-clmul-sim\r\n\r\nAlso refactored crc64_clmul to use the new macros created for crc32_clmul.\r\nAs well as moved similar functions to crc_clmul_common to eliminate duplicate code.\r\n\r\nI tested this on files doubling in size starting from 1 byte up to 1 Gigabyte.\r\nDuring testing I found that crc32_clmul can run up to 70% faster than crc32_generic,\r\nand has an average speed increase of 58.4% for sizes greater than 16 bytes.\r\n\r\nI also used this to test the reworked version of crc64_clmul.\r\nThis version of crc64_clmul is an average of 3.9% faster than the original implementation.\r\nThis speed increase is due to some inline assembly as well as changing around the order of some if statements. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been reviewed and added / updated if needed (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Build was run locally and without warnings or errors\r\n- [X] All previous and new tests pass\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request type\r\n\r\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type, submit multiple\r\npull requests if needed. --> \r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [X] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, renaming, typo fix)\r\n- [X] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other (please describe): \r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\ncrc32\\_fast currently only uses a generic implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nI added an implementation for crc32 that makes use of clmul in crc32_fast.c \r\nAlso refactored crc64_clmul implementation to use the same macros as crc32_clmul\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nHere is the output from both tests that gave me the statistics above.\r\n\r\nthe number of unique files tested on and the number of times the crc is run\r\ndecrease as the bytes get larger so the benchmark does not take too long.\r\n\r\nThe 64 and 32 spd+ show the percentage speed increase over the generic.\r\nThe percentage on the graph show the combined average for all types.\r\nFor example (50% is twice as fast, 200% is twice as slow)\r\n```\r\n64 generic: #\t\t64 clmul: +\r\n32 generic: =\t\t32 clmul: *\r\n\r\n#bytes, #files,   #crc's,  64spd+,  32spd+: 0%          50%          100%        150%         200%\r\n

for the PR, this is something we have wanted to implement since CLMUL was added for CRC64. 70% speed up over the generic method is a great speedup!\r\n\r\nIf you are willing, can you do some additional benchmarks for us since you already have a framework setup? We are wondering what impact the compiler has, so can you show us differences between using GCC and Clang? This especially matters when it comes to the 3% speed up you mentioned for the inline asm. 3% isn't that significant, especially if its only for CRC32. It adds extra complexity to the code and makes it harder to maintain long-term, so we want to make sure it is worth it. Similarly, can you try making CRC_SIMD_BODY an inline function instead of a macro? This could make it easier to read/maintain. If it has a significant impact on performance then we should stick to a macro.\r\n\r\nSo in summary, can you benchmark:\r\n\r\n- Impact of using GCC versus Clang in general\r\n- Impact of  removing the inline asm (GCC and Clang both)\r\n- Impact of replacing CRC_SIMD_BODY macro with inline function (GCC and Clang both)\r\n\r\nYou don't need to make this change now, but before merging it would be great if you can clean up the commits:\r\n\r\n- Label each commit with \"liblzma:\". We do this since it helps keep the commit log consistent and organized.\r\n- Please squash commits 1, 3, and 5 into a single commit. I understand this is how you developed it and the thought process makes sense. But it will help the commit log stay cleaner if we don't have to create crc_clmul_macros.h just to later rename its variables and rename the file itself.\r\n\r\nFeel free to add fix up commits as we go through the review process but at the end we will need these changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1735724045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-26T15:00:44Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}

an implementation for crc32 that makes use of clmul.\r\nCode for this implementation was written by Ilya Kurdyukov and can be found here.\r\nhttps://github.com/ilyakurdyukov/crc-clmul-sim\r\n\r\nAlso refactored crc64_clmul to use the new macros created for crc32_clmul.\r\nAs well as moved similar functions to crc_clmul_common to eliminate duplicate code.\r\n\r\nI tested this on files doubling in size starting from 1 byte up to 1 Gigabyte.\r\nDuring testing I found that crc32_clmul can run up to 70% faster than crc32_generic,\r\nand has an average speed increase of 58.4% for sizes greater than 16 bytes.\r\n\r\nI also used this to test the reworked version of crc64_clmul.\r\nThis version of crc64_clmul is an average of 3.9% faster than the original implementation.\r\nThis speed increase is due to some inline assembly as well as changing around the order of some if statements. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [

only uses a generic implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nI added an implementation for crc32 that makes use of clmul in crc32_fast.c \r\nAlso refactored crc64_clmul implementation to use the same macros as crc32_clmul\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nHere is the output from both tests that gave me the statistics above.\r\n\r\nthe number of unique files tested on and the number of times the crc is run\r\ndecrease as the bytes get larger so the benchmark does not take too long.\r\n\r\nThe 64 and 32 spd+ show the percentage speed increase over the generic.\r\nThe percentage on the graph show the combined average for all types.\r\nFor example (50% is twice as fast, 200% is twice as slow)\r\n```\r\n64 generic: #\t\t64 clmul: +\r\n32 generic: =\t\t32 clmul: *\r\n\r\n#bytes, #files,   #crc's,  64spd+,  32spd+: 0%          50%          100%        150%         200%\r\n

an implementation for crc32 that makes use of clmul.\r\nCode for this implementation was written by Ilya Kurdyukov and can be found here.\r\nhttps://github.com/ilyakurdyukov/crc-clmul-sim\r\n\r\nAlso refactored crc64_clmul to use the new macros created for crc32_clmul.\r\nAs well as moved similar functions to crc_clmul_common to eliminate duplicate code.\r\n\r\nI tested this on files doubling in size starting from 1 byte up to 1 Gigabyte.\r\nDuring testing I found that crc32_clmul can run up to 70% faster than crc32_generic,\r\nand has an average speed increase of 58.4% for sizes greater than 16 bytes.\r\n\r\nI also used this to test the reworked version of crc64_clmul.\r\nThis version of crc64_clmul is an average of 3.9% faster than the original implementation.\r\nThis speed increase is due to some inline assembly as well as changing around the order of some if statements. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been reviewed and added / updated if needed (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Build was run locally and without warnings or errors\r\n- [X] All previous and new tests pass\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request type\r\n\r\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type, submit multiple\r\npull requests if needed. --> \r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [X] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, renaming, typo fix)\r\n- [X] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other (please describe): \r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\ncrc32\\_fast currently only uses a generic implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nI added an implementation for crc32 that makes use of clmul in crc32_fast.c \r\nAlso refactored crc64_clmul implementation to use the same macros as crc32_clmul\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nHere is the output from both tests that gave me the statistics above.\r\n\r\nthe number of unique files tested on and the number of times the crc is run\r\ndecrease as the bytes get larger so the benchmark does not take too long.\r\n\r\nThe 64 and 32 spd+ show the percentage speed increase over the generic.\r\nThe percentage on the graph show the combined average for all types.\r\nFor example (50% is twice as fast, 200% is twice as slow)\r\n```\r\n64 generic: #\t\t64 clmul: +\r\n32 generic: =\t\t32 clmul: *\r\n\r\n#bytes, #files,   #crc's,  64spd+,  32spd+: 0%          50%          100%        150%         200%\r\n

an implementation for crc32 that makes use of clmul.\r\nCode for this implementation was written by Ilya Kurdyukov and can be found here.\r\nhttps://github.com/ilyakurdyukov/crc-clmul-sim\r\n\r\nAlso refactored crc64_clmul to use the new macros created for crc32_clmul.\r\nAs well as moved similar functions to crc_clmul_common to eliminate duplicate code.\r\n\r\nI tested this on files doubling in size starting from 1 byte up to 1 Gigabyte.\r\nDuring testing I found that crc32_clmul can run up to 70% faster than crc32_generic,\r\nand has an average speed increase of 58.4% for sizes greater than 16 bytes.\r\n\r\nI also used this to test the reworked version of crc64_clmul.\r\nThis version of crc64_clmul is an average of 3.9% faster than the original implementation.\r\nThis speed increase is due to some inline assembly as well as changing around the order of some if statements. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been reviewed and added / updated if needed (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Build was run locally and without warnings or errors\r\n- [X] All previous and new tests pass\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request type\r\n\r\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type, submit multiple\r\npull requests if needed. --> \r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [X] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, renaming, typo fix)\r\n- [X] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other (please describe): \r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\ncrc32\\_fast currently only uses a generic implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nI added an implementation for crc32 that makes use of clmul in crc32_fast.c \r\nAlso refactored crc64_clmul implementation to use the same macros as crc32_clmul\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nHere is the output from both tests that gave me the statistics above.\r\n\r\nthe number of unique files tested on and the number of times the crc is run\r\ndecrease as the bytes get larger so the benchmark does not take too long.\r\n\r\nThe 64 and 32 spd+ show the percentage speed increase over the generic.\r\nThe percentage on the graph show the combined average for all types.\r\nFor example (50% is twice as fast, 200% is twice as slow)\r\n```\r\n64 generic: #\t\t64 clmul: +\r\n32 generic: =\t\t32 clmul: *\r\n\r\n#bytes, #files,   #crc's,  64spd+,  32spd+: 0%          50%          100%        150%         200%\r\n

an implementation for crc32 that makes use of clmul.\r\nCode for this implementation was written by Ilya Kurdyukov and can be found here.\r\nhttps://github.com/ilyakurdyukov/crc-clmul-sim\r\n\r\nAlso refactored crc64_clmul to use the new macros created for crc32_clmul.\r\nAs well as moved similar functions to crc_clmul_common to eliminate duplicate code.\r\n\r\nI tested this on files doubling in size starting from 1 byte up to 1 Gigabyte.\r\nDuring testing I found that crc32_clmul can run up to 70% faster than crc32_generic,\r\nand has an average speed increase of 58.4% for sizes greater than 16 bytes.\r\n\r\nI also used this to test the reworked version of crc64_clmul.\r\nThis version of crc64_clmul is an average of 3.9% faster than the original implementation.\r\nThis speed increase is due to some inline assembly as well as changing around the order of some if statements. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been reviewed and added / updated if needed (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Build was run locally and without warnings or errors\r\n- [X] All previous and new tests pass\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request type\r\n\r\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type, submit multiple\r\npull requests if needed. --> \r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [X] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, renaming, typo fix)\r\n- [X] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other (please describe): \r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\ncrc32\\_fast currently only uses a generic implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nI added an implementation for crc32 that makes use of clmul in crc32_fast.c \r\nAlso refactored crc64_clmul implementation to use the same macros as crc32_clmul\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nHere is the output from both tests that gave me the statistics above.\r\n\r\nthe number of unique files tested on and the number of times the crc is run\r\ndecrease as the bytes get larger so the benchmark does not take too long.\r\n\r\nThe 64 and 32 spd+ show the percentage speed increase over the generic.\r\nThe percentage on the graph show the combined average for all types.\r\nFor example (50% is twice as fast, 200% is twice as slow)\r\n```\r\n64 generic: #\t\t64 clmul: +\r\n32 generic: =\t\t32 clmul: *\r\n\r\n#bytes, #files,   #crc's,  64spd+,  32spd+: 0%          50%          100%        150%         200%\r\n

an implementation for crc32 that makes use of clmul.\r\nCode for this implementation was written by Ilya Kurdyukov and can be found here.\r\nhttps://github.com/ilyakurdyukov/crc-clmul-sim\r\n\r\nAlso refactored crc64_clmul to use the new macros created for crc32_clmul.\r\nAs well as moved similar functions to crc_clmul_common to eliminate duplicate code.\r\n\r\nI tested this on files doubling in size starting from 1 byte up to 1 Gigabyte.\r\nDuring testing I found that crc32_clmul can run up to 70% faster than crc32_generic,\r\nand has an average speed increase of 58.4% for sizes greater than 16 bytes.\r\n\r\nI also used this to test the reworked version of crc64_clmul.\r\nThis version of crc64_clmul is an average of 3.9% faster than the original implementation.\r\nThis speed increase is due to some inline assembly as well as changing around the order of some if statements. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been reviewed and added / updated if needed (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Build was run locally and without warnings or errors\r\n- [X] All previous and new tests pass\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request type\r\n\r\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type, submit multiple\r\npull requests if needed. --> \r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [X] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, renaming, typo fix)\r\n- [X] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other (please describe): \r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\ncrc32\\_fast currently only uses a generic implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nI added an implementation for crc32 that makes use of clmul in crc32_fast.c \r\nAlso refactored crc64_clmul implementation to use the same macros as crc32_clmul\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nHere is the output from both tests that gave me the statistics above.\r\n\r\nthe number of unique files tested on and the number of times the crc is run\r\ndecrease as the bytes get larger so the benchmark does not take too long.\r\n\r\nThe 64 and 32 spd+ show the percentage speed increase over the generic.\r\nThe percentage on the graph show the combined average for all types.\r\nFor example (50% is twice as fast, 200% is twice as slow)\r\n```\r\n64 generic: #\t\t64 clmul: +\r\n32 generic: =\t\t32 clmul: *\r\n\r\n#bytes, #files,   #crc's,  64spd+,  32spd+: 0%          50%          100%        150%         200%\r\n

This change stops the ticker when it is no longer needed.\n\n### [`v1.58.1`](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases/tag/v1.58.1): Release 1.58.1\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-go/compare/v1.58.0...v1.58.1)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   grpc: fix a bug that was decrementing active RPC count too early for streaming RPCs; leading to channel moving to IDLE even though it had open streams\n-   grpc: fix a bug where transports were not being closed upon channel entering IDLE\n\n### [`v1.58.0`](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases/tag/v1.58.0): Release 1.58.0\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-go/compare/v1.57.0...v1.58.0)\n\n### API Changes\n\nSee [#&#8203;6472](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6472) for details about these changes.\n\n-   balancer: add `StateListener` to `NewSubConnOptions` for `SubConn` state updates and deprecate `Balancer.UpdateSubConnState` ([#&#8203;6481](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6481))\n    -   `UpdateSubConnState` will be deleted in the future.\n-   balancer: add `SubConn.Shutdown` and deprecate `Balancer.RemoveSubConn` ([#&#8203;6493](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6493))\n    -   `RemoveSubConn` will be deleted in the future.\n-   resolver: remove deprecated `AddressType` ([#&#8203;6451](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6451))\n    -   This was previously used as a signal to enable the \"grpclb\" load balancing policy, and to pass LB addresses to the policy.  Instead, `balancer/grpclb/state.Set()` should be used to add these addresses to the name resolver's output.
