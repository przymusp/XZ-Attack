The background on an isolated code span in a table cell looks terrible, so the stylesheet intentionally overrides this.\r\n\r\n> On the first row, cook doesn't have the gray background. \r\n\r\nWhen a column has only monospace text, it should have the `m` style instead of applying monospace to the text of every cell in it. See https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/tables/format-cell-content/#cell-styles-and-their-operators I mentioned that not just because it saves typing, but it's the primary reason why this CSS rule exists. If it doesn't, then the monospace style on a column causes the background to appear on all text in that column, which looks gaudy.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, based on the HTML that Asciidoctor produces, there's no way to differentiate between a normal table cell with a single code span and a monospace table cell. However, what I might consider is only applying this rule if the code span has no CSS class (no role). That would allow you to preserve the inline styling of the code span by adding a role.\r\n\r\n```\r\n| [.span]`--sweet`\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe name of the role wouldn't matter.
