[Here is some discussion about these selectors.](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3216)\r\n\r\n> One possible docinfo workaround in the interim is to use JavaScript\r\n\r\nThanks! I will keep that in mind. The other workarounds are starting to feel OK now that I understand the overall issue better.\r\n\r\n> With my proposal, if you want to ensure there is a background, you have to add a role to the code that is surrounded by only text (for example, ``` [.span]`code` ```)\r\n\r\nIn theory someone might have a document with `` [.green]`--green-option` `` in a table cell so adding `:not([class])` to CSS would make the gray background appear. I suppose any change has some chance of backward incompatibility. For example, `:not(.keep-background)` has a small chance of namespace conflict.\r\n\r\nUsing `` [.span]#`code`# `` is two more characters to type. It increases the HTML size more but this needs no stylesheet changes. (`` _{empty}_ `code` `` has smaller HTML size but it's otherwise a little odd. `` __ __ `empty` `` would be the simplest to type but it affects asciidoctor-pdf output so this method shouldn't be used.)\r\n\r\nSince there already are workarounds with similar-enough complexity as your suggestion, I guess it's not worth changing the stylesheet solely to add a new workaround variant.\r\n\r\nCustom table roles can be a workaround in some cases. The current `:only-child` magic can be overriden for specific columns in docinfo:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntable.keep-bg-1 > tbody > tr > td:nth-child(1) > p > code,\r\ntable.keep-bg-2 > tbody > tr > td:nth-child(2) > p > code,\r\ntable.keep-bg-3 > tbody > tr > td:nth-child(3) > p > code,\r\ntable.no-bg-in-first-only > tbody > tr > td:nth-child(n+2) > p > code {\r\n  padding: .1em .5ex;\r\n  background: #f7f7f8;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may be nicer than needing to mark individual monospace strings in the cells.\r\n\r\n> We could add a CSS class to the cell that is a monospace style, but that's a (minor) breaking change and can only be done in a minor or major release. This may be inconvenient, but it's just where we are.\r\n\r\nHasty frequent changes would be far more inconvenient. :-) The stability of the HTML output is appreciated.\r\n\r\n> I think it's perfectly reasonable to add more information into the HTML to avoid this kind of situation, which we can do in the new HTML converter, as I mentioned.\r\n\r\nGreat! I know it will take time until the new HTML converter is out but it's good to hear that this detail has been taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues/comments/1883602016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-09T18:50:30Z","org":{"id":3137042,"login":"asciidoctor","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/asciidoctor","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3137042?"}}
