Describe the Feature\n\nCan you please add methods in SeekableXZInputStream ability to write straight into an existing java.nio.ByteBuffer\r\n\r\nThis is to replicate something like \r\n\r\n```\r\nByteBuffer bytebuffer = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(65536);\r\nRandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(filePath, \"r\");\r\nFileChannel fc = raf.getChannel();\r\nByteBuffer.allocateDirect(this.bufferSize);\r\n\r\n// call next statements many ties  by seeking various positions\r\nfc.read(bytebuffer);\r\nbytebuffer.flip();\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Complications\n\nByteBuffer is available since old versions of java, so adding this feature should not be an issue.\n\n### Will I try to implement this new feature?\n\nNo","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz-java/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz-java/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz-java/issues/comments/1938620841","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz-java/issues/2#issuecomment-1938620841","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz-java/issues/2","id":1938620841,"node_id":"IC_kwDOIQBPLs5zjQGp","user":{"login":"bokken","id":2996845,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTY4NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2996845?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bokken","html_url":"https://github.com/bokken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bokken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bokken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bokken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bokken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bokken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bokken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bokken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bokken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bokken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-12T12:50:11Z","updated_at":"2024-02-12T12:50:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Is
