It should be faster on all\narchs and it's compatible with strict-align archs too. In\ncontrast to XZ Utils, this implementation is little-endian only\nto keep it simpler.\n\nGood speed on big endian requires that byteswap in VarHandle is\nfast. Testing this code on x86-64 with ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN in\nbytesToInt initialization, the difference is maybe 1 %. So on\nx86-64 it doesn't matter much which endianness is used. Hopefully\nit's like that on the few big endian systems with Java too.\n\nSeparate big endian version might be considered *if* it seems valuable\nenough and that someone can also properly test it on real hardware.\n\nThe flattening of TABLE[] helped here. Testing it on the pre-VarHandle\ncode, it didn't matter much with OpenJDK 21 (maybe a tiny bit faster)\nbut it was slower on Java 8. Now that the old code is for Java 8 only,\nit seems best to leave it unchanged.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz-java/commits/47930fa864d4003afeef7966b867d2c6cb37b3a1"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-11T14:29:57Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
