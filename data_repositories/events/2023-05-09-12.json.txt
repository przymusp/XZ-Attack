It is used to provide a recommended Block\nsize for a given filter chain.\n\nThis function is helpful to determine the maximum Block size for the\nmultithreaded .xz encoder when one wants to change the filters between\nblocks. Then, this determined Block size can be provided to\nlzma_stream_encoder_mt() in the lzma_mt options parameter when\nintializing the coder. This requires one to know all the filter chains\nthey are using before starting to encode (or at least the filter chain\nthat will need the largest Block size), but that isn't a bad limitation.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/commits/0ae3ced2874a0adacd024378d6745bed5864d1fc"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-09T12:56:57Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
