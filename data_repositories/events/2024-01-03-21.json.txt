A cell with just monospace text should be displayed not as a code span, but as monospace text. If they want it to appear as a code span, then they need to specify it as such. This is how you can get two different appearances. Logically, there's just no other way it can be.\r\n\r\n> What do you think about adding a class for table cells that use the monospace (m) style, and then changing the stylesheet to drop the background in this case?\r\n\r\nThat's a significant change (since it modifies the HTML) and I don't think we can rely on it until at least a minor version (as you suggested), perhaps even a major one (in the latter case, it would be more suitable for the new HTML converter in development).\r\n\r\nWith that said, I still think that a normal cell with a single code span should look the same as a monospace table cell. There are cases when you need to use that form to achieve something (such as to add a note). That's why I think using the role is the more adequate solution. It allows you to control which style you get all of the time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues/comments/1875993713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-03T21:26:46Z","org":{"id":3137042,"login":"asciidoctor","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/asciidoctor","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3137042?"}}
