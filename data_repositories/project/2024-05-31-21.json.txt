#37197.\r\n\r\n- [x] Changes comply with the [maintainer guide](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-docs/blob/main/vcpkg/contributing/maintainer-guide.md).\r\n- [x] SHA512s are updated for each updated download.\r\n- [x] The \"supports\" clause reflects platforms that may be fixed by this new version.\r\n- [x] Any fixed [CI baseline](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/scripts/ci.baseline.txt) entries are removed from that file.\r\n- [x] Any patches that are no longer applied are deleted from the port's directory.\r\n- [x] The version database is fixed by rerunning `./vcpkg x-add-version --all` and committing the result.\r\n- [x] Only one version is added to each modified port's versions file.\r\n\r\nThe update to version 5.6.0, includes the following changes\r\n* the patches were adapted for changes in the new version (I cannot check if the patch for iOS support was adapted correctly)\r\n* the new tools `lzmadec` and `lzmainfo` are handled in the same manner as the existing tools `xz` and `xzdec` \r\n* ~nls was disabled to sidestep an issue with installing the man pages~\r\n* ~a new feature `nls` was added to enable native language support. This was necessary to handle a new optional dependency on `gettext` so that the existing `tools` feature continues to work.~\r\n* nls support was not added, yet.

Possible causes are:\r\n\r\n      1. You are actually using an HTTP proxy, but setting HTTPS_PROXY variable\r\n         to `https://address:port`. This is not correct, because `https://` prefix\r\n         claims the proxy is an HTTPS proxy, while your proxy (v2ray, shadowsocksr\r\n         , etc..) is an HTTP proxy. Try setting `http://address:port` to both\r\n         HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY instead.\r\n\r\n      2. If you are using Windows, vcpkg will automatically use your Windows IE Proxy Settings\r\n         set by your proxy software. See https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/77\r\n         The value set by your proxy might be wrong, or have same `https://` prefix issue.\r\n\r\n      3. Your proxy's remote server is out of service.\r\n\r\n      If you've tried directly download the link, and believe this is not a temporary\r\n      download server failure, please submit an issue at https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/issues\r\n      to report this upstream download server failure.\r\n\r\n\r\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\r\n  scripts/cmake/vcpkg_download_distfile.cmake:270 (z_vcpkg_download_distfile_show_proxy_and_fail)\r\n  scripts/cmake/vcpkg_from_github.cmake:106 (vcpkg_download_distfile)\r\n  ports/liblzma/portfile.cmake:1 (vcpkg_from_github)\r\n  scripts/ports.cmake:168 (include)\r\n\r\n\r\nerror: building liblzma:x64-windows failed with: BUILD_FAILED\r\nElapsed time to handle liblzma:x64-windows: 3.2 s\r\nPlease ensure you're using the latest port files with `git pull` and `vcpkg update`.\r\nThen check for known issues at:\r\n  https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+in%3Atitle+liblzma\r\nYou can submit a new issue at:\r\n  https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/new?title=[liblzma]+Build+error&body=Copy+issue+body+from+D%3A%2Fvcpkg%2Finstalled%2Fvcpkg%2Fissue_body.md","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/37893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/37893/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/comments/2143029195","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/37893#issuecomment-2143029195","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/37893","id":2143029195,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBBJcqc5_vAfL","user":{"login":"Neustradamus","id":104737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDczNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neustradamus","html_url":"https://github.com/Neustradamus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neustradamus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neustradamus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neustradamus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neustradamus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neustradamus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neustradamus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neustradamus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neustradamus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neustradamus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-31T21:55:25Z","updated_at":"2024-05-31T21:55:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@teo-tsirpanis has done a PR about the new XZ version (5.6.2) here:\r\n- https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/pull/39024\r\n\r\ncc: @carsten-grimm.\r\n\r\nLinked to:\r\n- https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/37893\r\n- https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/pull/37841\r\n- https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/37839\r\n- https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/pull/37199\r\n- https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/37197\r\n- https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/pull/34306\r\n\r\nOfficial XZ links:\r\n- https://tukaani.org/\r\n- https://tukaani.org/xz/\r\n- https://tukaani.org/xz/#_stable\r\n- https://tukaani.org/xz-backdoor/\r\n- https://github.com/tukaani-project/\r\n- https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/comments/2143029195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-31T21:55:27Z","org":{"id":6154722,"login":"microsoft","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/microsoft","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?"}}
