Since the\ngrep tests only checked for \"define HAVE_ENCODER_ARM\", this would match\non HAVE_ENCODER_ARM64 or HAVE_ENCODER_ARMTHUMB.\n\nNow the config.h feature test requires \" 1\" at the end to prevent the\nprefix problem. have_feature() was also updated for this even though\nthere were known current bugs affecting it. This is just in case future\nfeatures have a similar prefix problem.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/commits/2c189bb00af73dc7ba1a67a9d274d5be03ee3a88"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-07-14T13:36:33Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
