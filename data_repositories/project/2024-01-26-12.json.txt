The filter can be used\r\n      for 32-bit and 64-bit binaries with either little or big\r\n      endianness. In liblzma, the Filter ID is LZMA_FILTER_RISCV (0x0B)\r\n      and the xz option is --riscv. liblzma filter string syntax\r\n      recognizes this filter as \"riscv\".\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - Added lzma_mt_block_size() to recommend a Block size for\r\n          multithreaded encoding\r\n\r\n        - Added CLMUL-based CRC32 on x86-64 and E2K with runtime\r\n          processor detection. Similar to CRC64, on 32-bit x86 it\r\n          isn't available unless --disable-assembler is used.\r\n\r\n        - Implemented GNU indirect function (IFUNC) as a runtime\r\n          function dispatching method for CRC32 and CRC64 fast\r\n          implementations on x86. Only GNU/Linux (glibc) and FreeBSD\r\n          builds will use IFUNC, unless --enable-ifunc is specified to\r\n          configure.\r\n\r\n        - Added definitions of mask values like\r\n          LZMA_INDEX_CHECK_MASK_CRC32 to <lzma/index.h>.\r\n\r\n        - The XZ logo is now included in the Doxygen generated\r\n          documentation.

This improves\r\n          compression speed and creates .xz files that can be\r\n          decompressed multithreaded at the cost of increased memory\r\n          usage and slightly worse compression ratio.\r\n\r\n        - Added new command line option --filters to set the filter\r\n          chain using liblzma filter string syntax.\r\n\r\n        - Added new command line options --filters1 ... --filters9 to\r\n          set additional filter chains using liblzma filter string\r\n          syntax. The --block-list option now allows specifying filter\r\n          chains that were set using these new options.\r\n\r\n        - Added support for Linux Landlock as a sandboxing method.\r\n\r\n        - xzdec now supports pledge(2), Capsicum, and Linux Landlock as\r\n          sandboxing methods.\r\n\r\n        - Progress indicator time stats remain accurate after pausing\r\n          xz with SIGTSTP.\r\n\r\n        - Ported xz and xzdec to Windows MSVC. Visual Studio 2015 or\r\n          later is required.\r\n\r\n    * CMake Build:\r\n\r\n        - Supports pledge(2), Capsicum, and Linux Landlock sandboxing\r\n          methods.\r\n\r\n        - Replacement functions for getopt_long() are used on platforms\r\n          that do not have it.\r\n\r\n    * Enabled unaligned access by default on PowerPC64LE and on RISC-V\r\n      targets that define __riscv_misaligned_fast.\r\n\r\n    * Tests:\r\n\r\n        - Added two new fuzz targets to OSS-Fuzz.\r\n\r\n        - Implemented Continuous Integration (CI) testing using\r\n          GitHub Actions.\r\n\r\n    * Changed quoting style from `...' to '...' in all messages,\r\n      scripts, and documentation.\r\n\r\n    * Added basic Codespell support to help catch typo errors.\r\n```","short_description_html":"<p>Here is an extract from the NEWS file:</p>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"5.5.1alpha (2024-01-26)\n\n    * Added a new filter for RISC-V binaries.
