an implementation for crc32 that makes use of clmul.\r\nCode for this implementation was written by Ilya Kurdyukov and can be found here.\r\nhttps://github.com/ilyakurdyukov/crc-clmul-sim\r\n\r\nAlso refactored crc64_clmul to use the new macros created for crc32_clmul.\r\nAs well as moved similar functions to crc_clmul_common to eliminate duplicate code.\r\n\r\nI tested this on files doubling in size starting from 1 byte up to 1 Gigabyte.\r\nDuring testing I found that crc32_clmul can run up to 70% faster than crc32_generic,\r\nand has an average speed increase of 58.4% for sizes greater than 16 bytes.\r\n\r\nI also used this to test the reworked version of crc64_clmul.\r\nThis version of crc64_clmul is an average of 3.9% faster than the original implementation.\r\nThis speed increase is due to some inline assembly as well as changing around the order of some if statements. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been reviewed and added / updated if needed (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Build was run locally and without warnings or errors\r\n- [X] All previous and new tests pass\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request type\r\n\r\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type, submit multiple\r\npull requests if needed. --> \r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [X] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, renaming, typo fix)\r\n- [X] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other (please describe): \r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\ncrc32\\_fast currently only uses a generic implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nI added an implementation for crc32 that makes use of clmul in crc32_fast.c \r\nAlso refactored crc64_clmul implementation to use the same macros as crc32_clmul\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nHere is the output from both tests that gave me the statistics above.\r\n\r\nthe number of unique files tested on and the number of times the crc is run\r\ndecrease as the bytes get larger so the benchmark does not take too long.\r\n\r\nThe 64 and 32 spd+ show the percentage speed increase over the generic.\r\nThe percentage on the graph show the combined average for all types.\r\nFor example (50% is twice as fast, 200% is twice as slow)\r\n```\r\n64 generic: #\t\t64 clmul: +\r\n32 generic: =\t\t32 clmul: *\r\n\r\n#bytes, #files,   #crc's,  64spd+,  32spd+: 0%          50%          100%        150%         200%\r\n

an implementation for crc32 that makes use of clmul.\r\nCode for this implementation was written by Ilya Kurdyukov and can be found here.\r\nhttps://github.com/ilyakurdyukov/crc-clmul-sim\r\n\r\nAlso refactored crc64_clmul to use the new macros created for crc32_clmul.\r\nAs well as moved similar functions to crc_clmul_common to eliminate duplicate code.\r\n\r\nI tested this on files doubling in size starting from 1 byte up to 1 Gigabyte.\r\nDuring testing I found that crc32_clmul can run up to 70% faster than crc32_generic,\r\nand has an average speed increase of 58.4% for sizes greater than 16 bytes.\r\n\r\nI also used this to test the reworked version of crc64_clmul.\r\nThis version of crc64_clmul is an average of 3.9% faster than the original implementation.\r\nThis speed increase is due to some inline assembly as well as changing around the order of some if statements. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been reviewed and added / updated if needed (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Build was run locally and without warnings or errors\r\n- [X] All previous and new tests pass\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request type\r\n\r\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type, submit multiple\r\npull requests if needed. --> \r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [X] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, renaming, typo fix)\r\n- [X] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other (please describe): \r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\ncrc32\\_fast currently only uses a generic implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nI added an implementation for crc32 that makes use of clmul in crc32_fast.c \r\nAlso refactored crc64_clmul implementation to use the same macros as crc32_clmul\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nHere is the output from both tests that gave me the statistics above.\r\n\r\nthe number of unique files tested on and the number of times the crc is run\r\ndecrease as the bytes get larger so the benchmark does not take too long.\r\n\r\nThe 64 and 32 spd+ show the percentage speed increase over the generic.\r\nThe percentage on the graph show the combined average for all types.\r\nFor example (50% is twice as fast, 200% is twice as slow)\r\n```\r\n64 generic: #\t\t64 clmul: +\r\n32 generic: =\t\t32 clmul: *\r\n\r\n#bytes, #files,   #crc's,  64spd+,  32spd+: 0%          50%          100%        150%         200%\r\n
