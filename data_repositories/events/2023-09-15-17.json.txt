It contains a corrupt .lzma file which uses a tiny 256-byte dictionary. So decompression needs very little memory. The reporter claims that decompressing it \"could cause endless output\".\r\n\r\nBoth XZ Utils and even the long-deprecated LZMA Utils produce 114,881,179 bytes of output from the payload before reporting an error. This is not \"endless output\". The decompression speed is good too.\r\n\r\nThere is no denial of service or other bug with this file.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1721603163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-15T17:16:20Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
