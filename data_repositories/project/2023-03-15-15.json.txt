Fuzzing proved to be very effective having no false positives. It provides a crashing input which helps you to reproduce and debug any finding easily. The integration of your project into the OSS-Fuzz platform will enable continuous fuzzing of your project by Jazzer.\r\n\r\n**What do you need to do?**\r\nThe integration requires the maintainer or one established project commiter to deal with the bug reports.\r\n\r\nYou need to create or provide one email address that is associated with a google account as per [here](https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/getting-started/accepting-new-projects/). When a bug is found, you will receive an email that will provide you with access to ClusterFuzz, crash reports, code coverage reports and fuzzer statistics. More than 1 person can be included.\r\n\r\n**How Code Intelligence can support?**\r\nWe will continue to add more fuzz targets to improve code coverage over time. Furthermore, we are permanently enhancing fuzzing technologies by developing new fuzzers and more bug detectors.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions regarding fuzzing or the OSS-Fuzz integration.\n\n### Expected Complications\n\n_No response_\n\n### Will I try to implement this new feature?\n\nYes","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz-java/issues/3/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz-java/issues/3/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-15T15:37:22Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
