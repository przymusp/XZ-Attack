百度地图随便找了一家修电脑的门店，到店后闲聊几句，电脑维修人员他问我什么专业的，我说计算机，他说我也计算机，他问我现在前端用什么，我说什么 vue react 啥的，他给我来了一句，当时我们用的什么 ajax jQuery ，我沉默不语，然后最搞笑的来了，他手机响了: “美团外卖，您有新的订单”。</p>\n<p>我当时有点想笑，我也不知道为啥，可能就是单纯的被逗笑了。</p>\n<p>然后我买的内存条不合适（我本身的电脑的两个 8G 的槽）, 我只买了一个 16G 的，我换的话只能是 16 + 8 = 24 ，可能会损失一些性能之类的，这时他又来了一句:  \"你们计算机组成原理应该学过这个，我其实不怎么建议你换，当然你如果开虚拟机跑服务的话，应该也没事的\"， 我说我多开几个软件，跑一个小的微服务项目内存都有点吃紧，他说那还行，就这样吧，装上也可以用。</p>\n<p>这个时候我其实已经是笑不出来了，我在想，这会不会是十年后的我，平时组装个电脑，修个电脑，跑个外卖，跑个滴滴。</p>\n<p>骑着小街车回公司的时候，一直在想这件事，说实话，，这次交流就好像是一次跨时空对话一样，多少给了我一点冲击。我相信如果是各位经历这样的事情，也会有一些触动的。</p>\n\n

百度地图随便找了一家修电脑的门店，到店后闲聊几句，电脑维修人员他问我什么专业的，我说计算机，他说我也计算机，他问我现在前端用什么，我说什么 vue react 啥的，他给我来了一句，当时我们用的什么 ajax jQuery ，我沉默不语，然后最搞笑的来了，他手机响了: “美团外卖，您有新的订单”。</p>\n<p>我当时有点想笑，我也不知道为啥，可能就是单纯的被逗笑了。</p>\n<p>然后我买的内存条不合适（我本身的电脑的两个 8G 的槽）, 我只买了一个 16G 的，我换的话只能是 16 + 8 = 24 ，可能会损失一些性能之类的，这时他又来了一句:  \"你们计算机组成原理应该学过这个，我其实不怎么建议你换，当然你如果开虚拟机跑服务的话，应该也没事的\"， 我说我多开几个软件，跑一个小的微服务项目内存都有点吃紧，他说那还行，就这样吧，装上也可以用。</p>\n<p>这个时候我其实已经是笑不出来了，我在想，这会不会是十年后的我，平时组装个电脑，修个电脑，跑个外卖，跑个滴滴。</p>\n<p>骑着小街车回公司的时候，一直在想这件事，说实话，，这次交流就好像是一次跨时空对话一样，多少给了我一点冲击。我相信如果是各位经历这样的事情，也会有一些触动的。</p>\n\n

百度地图随便找了一家修电脑的门店，到店后闲聊几句，电脑维修人员他问我什么专业的，我说计算机，他说我也计算机，他问我现在前端用什么，我说什么 vue react 啥的，他给我来了一句，当时我们用的什么 ajax jQuery ，我沉默不语，然后最搞笑的来了，他手机响了: “美团外卖，您有新的订单”。</p>\n<p>我当时有点想笑，我也不知道为啥，可能就是单纯的被逗笑了。</p>\n<p>然后我买的内存条不合适（我本身的电脑的两个 8G 的槽）, 我只买了一个 16G 的，我换的话只能是 16 + 8 = 24 ，可能会损失一些性能之类的，这时他又来了一句:  \"你们计算机组成原理应该学过这个，我其实不怎么建议你换，当然你如果开虚拟机跑服务的话，应该也没事的\"， 我说我多开几个软件，跑一个小的微服务项目内存都有点吃紧，他说那还行，就这样吧，装上也可以用。</p>\n<p>这个时候我其实已经是笑不出来了，我在想，这会不会是十年后的我，平时组装个电脑，修个电脑，跑个外卖，跑个滴滴。</p>\n<p>骑着小街车回公司的时候，一直在想这件事，说实话，，这次交流就好像是一次跨时空对话一样，多少给了我一点冲击。我相信如果是各位经历这样的事情，也会有一些触动的。</p>\n\n

<code>crc64_resolve</code>，然后试图从内存中解析符号表，并查找 <code>RSA_public_decrypt@....plt</code> 符号，并将其指向的地址替换为后门代码。</p>\n<p>在 SSH 登录认证时，sshd 会调用该符号，并在服务器上执行攻击代码。但是其具体行为尚未被观测。</p>\n<h2>相关链接</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a
