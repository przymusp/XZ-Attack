A newer commit cannot keep the same sha1 unless it is based on the original commit containing the backdoor. This is an extremely important core security guarantee of git, with the unfortunate side effect that you cannot forge a fake commit that claims to be a newer commit but is actually a rebased one, even if you're the legal owner of the repository and you really have a good reason to want to do so.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2057973255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-15T23:23:37Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
