fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been reviewed and added / updated if needed (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Build was run locally and without warnings or errors\r\n- [X] All previous and new tests pass\r\n\r\nNote: Compile warnings are inevitable for MSVC when some variables can be either 64-bit (target x64) or 32-bit (target Win32) at compile time. Those warnings need extensive changes to clean up.\r\n\r\n## Pull request type\r\n\r\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type, submit multiple\r\npull requests if needed. --> \r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, renaming, typo fix)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [X] Other (please describe): \r\n\r\nMake xz buildable with MSVC.\r\nAdd 64-bit filesize support on Windows.\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\r\n\r\nxz does not build with MSVC.\r\nxz would refuse to handle files larger than 4 GiB.\r\n\r\n<!-- Related issue this PR addresses, if applicable -->\r\nRelated Issue URL: \r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by this\r\nPR. -->\r\n\r\nxz can be built with MSVC.\r\nxz can handle files larger than 4 GiB on Windows.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and\r\nmigration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR. -->\r\n\r\nI have added extensive MSVC build support in my own repo https://github.com/kiyolee/xz-win-build.\r\nIn addition to building xz, I have added support to build all tests as well.\r\nThis PR only covers code changes that were done while setting up my own
