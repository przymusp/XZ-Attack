I hadn't forgotten about this but we had higher priority things to work on instead. MSVC support for xz is still fairly recent, so adding it to the CI pipeline would be great. I'll take a look at your demo pipeline hopefully soon :)\r\n\r\nThe existing CI tests likely need a bit of a clean up anyway, some parts were written hastily by me. They have proven to be great for catching bugs though. We don't have plans for using CI for releases.\r\n\r\nThe assembly code is only for decoding so that explains your results. Using larger test files may help be sure that the results aren't due to noise.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1986837085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-09T12:00:46Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
