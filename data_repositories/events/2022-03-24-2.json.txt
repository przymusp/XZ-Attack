The LZMA avail_in value is unsigned, so it was treating the available in as a large positive number and trying to continue reading input. This resulted in the invalid read segmentation fault.  \r\n\r\nThis is a quick fix to the issue. I tested it on the file provided by [icycityone](https://github.com/icycityone) and it no longer segmentation faults. I am not sure if a deeper fix is needed to prevent zip->entry_bytes_remaining from being negative, but this will at least solve the problem in the short term. \r\n\r\nThank you to [icycityone](https://github.com/icycityone) for discovering and reporting this bug and thank you to Lasse Collin for discovering the source of the problem. \r\n\r\nfixes #1672 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libarchive/libarchive/issues/1682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libarchive/libarchive/issues/1682/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libarchive/libarchive/issues/comments/1077003179","html_url":"https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/pull/1682#issuecomment-1077003179","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libarchive/libarchive/issues/1682","id":1077003179,"node_id":"IC_kwDOADEhXM5AMcOr","user":{"login":"icycityone","id":12591745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkxNzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12591745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icycityone","html_url":"https://github.com/icycityone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icycityone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icycityone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icycityone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icycityone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icycityone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icycityone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icycityone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icycityone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icycityone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-24T02:27:12Z","updated_at":"2022-03-24T02:27:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"okï¼Œcan i apply for cve on this subject ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libarchive/libarchive/issues/comments/1077003179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-03-24T02:27:12Z","org":{"id":1354741,"login":"libarchive","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/libarchive","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1354741?"}}
