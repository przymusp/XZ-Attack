I haven't fully thought through it, but here are a few ideas I have had so far:\r\n- The GitHub Windows runner comes with CMake by default. You will not need to install it manually (https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/win/Windows2022-Readme.md)\r\n- It's probably a good idea to make most of the work be done in a separate script in the build-aux folder, similar to the concept of build-aux/ci_build.sh. The reason to do this is because the GitHub Workflow .yml files are harder to test/debug since you cannot run them locally. It's a lot easier to develop the script and then use the GitHub Workflow to wrap around it.\r\n- In the script, you should be able to specify the Visual Studios build with the -g option (https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/generator/Visual%20Studio%2017%202022.html).\r\n- After the generating step, `cmake --build` should compile and project\r\n- As of right now, CMake should not build the xz command line tool, just liblzma. The same number of tests should still build and pass, but I have not run these tests personally on MSVC so I cannot guarantee they will work as expected. If any of them fail unexpectedly, send us the log and we will fix it :)\r\n\r\nI hope this helps! Thanks again for your contributions so far. Let me know what other questions you may have.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1428123305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-13T15:18:39Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
