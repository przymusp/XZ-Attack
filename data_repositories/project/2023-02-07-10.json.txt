diff\r\n   The large amount of changes stem from my changes in reporting - new reports are done later in the process of creating the production image, after some selinux and grub changes are made in the image, but the old reports were made earlier, thus the larger than usual diff. But these changes are not relevant to this

new reports are done later in the process of creating the production image, after some selinux and grub changes are made in the image, but the old reports were made earlier, thus the larger than usual diff. But these changes are not relevant to this PR.","created_at":"2023-01-23T07:23:24Z","updated_at":"2023-02-07T10:30:27Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fa549a1b8290807bdb5bed7926d35e96b7f0cecc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2241368680,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjQxMzY4Njgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/flatcar/portage-stable/labels/main","name":"main","color":"b7931b","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/flatcar/portage-stable/pulls/409/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/flatcar/portage-stable/pulls/409/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/flatcar/portage-stable/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/flatcar/portage-stable/issues/409/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/flatcar/portage-stable/statuses/d6de633f36e2dd892be3bde6d7067a82dd8e0b17","head":{"label":"flatcar:buildbot/weekly-package-updates-2023-01-23","ref":"buildbot/weekly-package-updates-2023-01-23","sha":"d6de633f36e2dd892be3bde6d7067a82dd8e0b17","user":{"login":"flatcar","id":36193555,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM2MTkzNTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36193555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flatcar","html_url":"https://github.com/flatcar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flatcar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flatcar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flatcar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flatcar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flatcar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flatcar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flatcar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flatcar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flatcar/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123933465,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM5MzM0NjU=","name":"portage-stable","full_name":"flatcar/portage-stable","private":false,"owner":{"login":"flatcar","id":36193555,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM2MTkzNTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36193555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flatcar","html_url":"https://github.com/flatcar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flatcar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flatcar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flatcar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flatcar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flatcar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flatcar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flatcar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flatcar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flatcar/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/flatcar/portage-stable","description":"package
