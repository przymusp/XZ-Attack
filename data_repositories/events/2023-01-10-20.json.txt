The reporter has tested\nthis and it passes the tests included in the CMake build and\nperformance is good: raw CRC64 is 2-3 times faster than the\nC version of the slice-by-four method. (Note that liblzma doesn't\ninclude a MSVC-compatible version of the 32-bit x86 assembly code\nfor the slice-by-four method.)\n\nThanks to Iouri Kharon for figuring out a fix, testing, and\nbenchmarking.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/commits/0b8fa310cf56fec55663f62340e49e8e1441594f"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-01-10T20:17:16Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
