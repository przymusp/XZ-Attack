Vetting someone to take over is not zero work. When it comes to SAML specifically, the potential for things to go wrong is high.\r\n\r\nI think you're asking the wrong question: Why should the weight of a set of repos, used primarily by _companies_, with record profits, rest upon the actions of one person for zero compensation?\r\n\r\nPressure to give free labor at the expense of one's well being is what enabled the JiaT75 situation. Complaining that the repo is not well maintained enough is literally how JiaT75 got commit rights in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe mental health of opensource contributors is greater than the needs of _companies_. If they cannot wait for the maintainer to find time, then they either need to compensate said maintainer so they prioritize the efforts OR they need to do the work themselves.\r\n\r\nThe code is open. Nothing is stopping anyone from forking it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SAML-Toolkits/java-saml/issues/comments/2049273989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-11T09:19:26Z","org":{"id":116213842,"login":"SAML-Toolkits","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/SAML-Toolkits","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116213842?"}}
