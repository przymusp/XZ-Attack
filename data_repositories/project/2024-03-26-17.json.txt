It should be faster on all\narchs and it's compatible with strict-align archs too. In\ncontrast to XZ Utils, this implementation is little-endian only\nto keep it simpler.\n\nGood speed on big endian requires that byteswap in VarHandle is\nfast. Testing this code on x86-64 with getIntBE, the difference\nis maybe 1 % or maybe no difference at all. So on x86-64 it\ndoesn't matter much which endianness is used. Hopefully it's\nlike that on the few big endian systems with Java too.\n\nSeparate big endian version might be considered *if* it seems valuable\nenough and that someone can also properly test it on real hardware.\n\nThe flattening of TABLE[] helped here. Testing it on the pre-VarHandle\ncode, it didn't matter much with OpenJDK 21 (maybe a tiny bit faster)\nbut it was slower on Java 8. Now that the old code is for Java 8 only,\nit seems best to leave it unchanged.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz-java/commits/523b99418606cb74e261a28b13585fd69787cb5a"},{"sha":"10b51ddb5a09213389bc8b9009418a9338c4e91c","author":{"email":"lasse.collin@tukaani.org","name":"Lasse Collin"},"message":"LZMAEncoderNormal: Don't call lz.getMatchLen with negative lenLimit.\n\nDoing so is fine for now but optimized versions of getMatchLen\nwon't like it.\n\nThe second hunk is mostly white space change as the if-block was\nindented more.\n\nThis doesn't affect speed.\n\nThanks to Brett Okken.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz-java/commits/10b51ddb5a09213389bc8b9009418a9338c4e91c"},{"sha":"4057b84909c5d4d6a598a63e1c37f054317dfe63","author":{"email":"lasse.collin@tukaani.org","name":"Lasse Collin"},"message":"Add minimal MatchLength with a static getLen method.\n\nEventually this will be used only by Java 8 (or older).","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz-java/commits/4057b84909c5d4d6a598a63e1c37f054317dfe63"},{"sha":"b4a172fb44d95258b8ef7e1fcb2bc00af126345f","author":{"email":"lasse.collin@tukaani.org","name":"Lasse Collin"},"message":"Use MatchLength.getLen in LZEncoder, BT4, and HC4.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz-java/commits/b4a172fb44d95258b8ef7e1fcb2bc00af126345f"},{"sha":"d8f33706de29e95dee6f9fdc21d14a95a28a60c2","author":{"email":"lasse.collin@tukaani.org","name":"Lasse Collin"},"message":"Add MatchLength.EXTRA_SIZE and use it in LZEncoder.\n\nIt's not needed with the basic MatchLength version but\nan optimized version will need it.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz-java/commits/d8f33706de29e95dee6f9fdc21d14a95a28a60c2"},{"sha":"011b6a32a6ba6f46e7a1a642b42f6ddd23f4288a","author":{"email":"lasse.collin@tukaani.org","name":"Lasse Collin"},"message":"Add BasicMatchLengthFinder and UnalignedLongLEMatchLengthFinder.\n\nThese require Java 9 or later.
