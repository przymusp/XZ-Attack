This library provides facilities for writing short text messages about the status of a program to `stderr`, disk files, or other sinks (via an extension API). See the [logging library documentation](https://abseil.io/docs/cpp/guides/logging) for more information.\n-   An extension point, [`AbslStringify()`](https://abseil.io/docs/cpp/guides/format#abslstringify), allows user-defined types to seamlessly work with Abseil's string formatting functions like `absl::StrCat()` and `absl::StrFormat()`.\n-   A [library for computing CRC32C checksums](https://togithub.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/crc/crc32c.h) has been added.\n-   Floating-point parsing now uses the [Eisel-Lemire algorithm](https://nigeltao.github.io/blog/2020/eisel-lemire.html), which provides a significant speed improvement.\n-   The flags library now provides suggestions for the closest flag(s) in the case of misspelled flags.\n-   Using [CMake to install Abseil](https://togithub.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/308bbf300fe9332130f4784c7a91fa2ad707d6e4) now makes the installed artifacts (in particular [`absl/base/options.h`](https://togithub.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/base/options.h)) reflect the compiled ABI.\n\n#### Breaking Changes:\n\n-   Abseil now requires at least C++14 and follows [Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). See [this table](https://togithub.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) for a list of currently supported versions compilers, platforms, and build tools.\n-   The legacy spellings of the thread annotation macros/functions (e.g. `GUARDED_BY()`) [have been removed by default](https://togithub.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/6acb60c161f1203e6eca929b87f2041da7714bfe) in favor of the `ABSL_` prefixed versions (e.g. `ABSL_GUARDED_BY()`) due to clashes with other libraries. The compatibility macro `ABSL_LEGACY_THREAD_ANNOTATIONS` can be defined on the compile command-line to temporarily restore these spellings, but this compatibility macro will be removed in the future.\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n-   The Abseil logging library in this release is not a feature-complete replacement for [glog](https://togithub.com/google/glog) yet. `VLOG` and `DFATAL` are examples of features that have not yet been released.\n\nBaseline: [`a69b0ae`](https://togithub.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/a69b0ae5cdba53a45617afc408618a3e1ac244de)\nCherry pick: [`35e8e3f`](https://togithub.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/35e8e3f7a2c6972d4c591448e8bbe4f9ed9f815a) (Patch 1)\nCherry pick: [`a0f9b46`](https://togithub.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/a0f9b465212aea24d3264b82d315b8ee59e8d7a0) (Patch 1)\nCherry pick: [`2de126c`](https://togithub.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/2de126cc5826a8d464270ead65a7a9a7b012b741) (Patch 2)\nCherry pick: [`807763a`](https://togithub.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/807763a7f57dcf0ba4af7c3b218013e8f525e811) (Patch 3)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>grpc/grpc-go</summary>\n\n### [`v1.55.0`](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases/tag/v1.55.0): Release 1.55.0\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-go/compare/v1.54.1...v1.55.0)\n\n### Behavior Changes\n\n-   xds: enable federation support by default ([#&#8203;6151](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6151))\n-   status: `status.Code` and `status.FromError` handle wrapped errors ([#&#8203;6031](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6031) and [#&#8203;6150](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6150))\n    -
