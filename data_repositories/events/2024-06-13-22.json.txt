The \"supports\" clause reflects platforms that may be fixed by this new version.\n- [ ] Any fixed [CI baseline](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/scripts/ci.baseline.txt) entries are removed from that file.\n- [ ] Any patches that are no longer applied are deleted from the port's directory.\n- [X] The version database is fixed by rerunning `./vcpkg x-add-version --all` and committing the result.\n- [X] Only one version is added to each modified port's versions file.\n\nThis PR updates liblzma to the just-released version 5.6.2. I first copied the reverted port for 5.6.0, and updated versions.\n\nI also enabled the tools feature on Windows; the tools seem to run fine there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/39024/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/39024/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/comments/2166873318","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/pull/39024#issuecomment-2166873318","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/39024","id":2166873318,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBBJcqc6BJ9zm","user":{"login":"Neustradamus","id":104737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDczNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neustradamus","html_url":"https://github.com/Neustradamus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neustradamus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neustradamus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neustradamus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neustradamus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neustradamus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neustradamus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neustradamus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neustradamus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neustradamus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-13T22:06:45Z","updated_at":"2024-06-13T22:06:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@BillyONeal: Of course.
