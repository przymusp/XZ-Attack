Currently, the two supported options are \"deflate\" (the compression method invented specifically for the original PK-ZIP implementation) and \"store\" (uncompressed).  This PR fixes a bug where even when the user specifically requested \"store\" compression, that would be ignored by libarchive in certain cases.  Instead, libarchive would force the use of \"deflate\" compression.\r\n\r\nI wrote the original logic here with the idea that \"store\" compression was incompatible with certain uses, but I've since spent a lot more time working with the corresponding Zip reading code in libarchive and agree with the author of this PR that I was being overly conservative and that there's no really strong reason not to use the compression that was specifically requested by the user.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libarchive/libarchive/issues/comments/2036151514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-04T04:12:48Z","org":{"id":1354741,"login":"libarchive","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/libarchive","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1354741?"}}
