A workaround\nfor these releases is to pass EGREP='grep -E' as an argument\nto configure in addition to --disable-threads.\n\nThe problem appeared when m4/ax_pthread.m4 was updated in\nthe commit 6629ed929cc7d45a11e385f357ab58ec15e7e4ad which\nintroduced the use of AC_EGREP_CPP. AC_EGREP_CPP calls\nAC_REQUIRE([AC_PROG_EGREP]) to set the shell variable EGREP\nbut this was only executed if POSIX threads were enabled.\nLibtool code also has AC_REQUIRE([AC_PROG_EGREP]) but Autoconf\nomits it as AC_PROG_EGREP has already been required earlier.\nThus, if not using POSIX threads, the shell variable EGREP\nwould be undefined in the Libtool code in configure.\n\nax_pthread.m4 is fine. The bug was in configure.ac which called\nAX_PTHREAD conditionally in an incorrect way. Using AS_CASE\nensures that all AC_REQUIREs get always run.\n\nThanks to Frank Busse for reporting the bug.\nFixes: https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/issues/45","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/commits/dcd6882cb91fb18fd5e3b51a1ca4ec818695f451"},{"sha":"edcde3e3871ae5ac4ed615c324b81d81d35973e0","author":{"email":"lasse.collin@tukaani.org","name":"Lasse Collin"},"message":"Update THANKS.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/commits/edcde3e3871ae5ac4ed615c324b81d81d35973e0"},{"sha":"260683a6e2d0525640729b3329b0c0009cda7122","author":{"email":"lasse.collin@tukaani.org","name":"Lasse Collin"},"message":"Build: configure.ac: Use AS_IF and AS_CASE where required.\n\nThis makes no functional difference in the generated configure\n(at least with the Autotools versions I have installed) but this\nchange might prevent future bugs like the one that was just\nfixed in the commit 5a5bd7f871818029d5ccbe189f087f591258c294.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/commits/260683a6e2d0525640729b3329b0c0009cda7122"},{"sha":"a2e129a81fe95261342b6f76a3c2474b95e4cf82","author":{"email":"lasse.collin@tukaani.org","name":"Lasse Collin"},"message":"Build: Add a comment that AC_PROG_CC_C99 is needed for Autoconf 2.69.\n\nIt's obsolete in Autoconf >= 2.70 and just an alias for AC_PROG_CC\nbut Autoconf 2.69 requires AC_PROG_CC_C99 to get a C99 compiler.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/commits/a2e129a81fe95261342b6f76a3c2474b95e4cf82"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-21T12:25:48Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
