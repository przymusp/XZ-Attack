 .SH NAME
 xzmore, lzmore \- view xz or lzma compressed (text) files
 .
 .SH SYNOPSIS
 .B xzmore
 .RI [ file ...]
 .br
 .B lzmore
 .RI [ file ...]
 .
 .SH DESCRIPTION
 .B xzmore
 displays text from compressed files to a terminal using
 .BR more (1).
 Files supported by
 .BR xz (1)
 are decompressed;
 other files are assumed to be in uncompressed form already.
 If no
 .I files
 are given,
 .B xzmore
 reads from standard input.
 See the
 .BR more (1)
 manual for the keyboard commands.
 .PP
 Note that scrolling backwards might not be possible
 depending on the implementation of
 .BR more (1).
 This is because
 .B xzmore
 uses a pipe to pass the decompressed data to
 .BR more (1).
 .BR xzless (1)
 uses
 .BR less (1)
 which provides more advanced features.
 .PP
 The command
 .B lzmore
 is provided for backward compatibility with LZMA Utils.

 .SH ENVIRONMENT
