They own the code they submit to us, our reviews only mean we verified this is a project maintainer, which unfortunately, \"Jia Tan\" was. \r\nIf they don't want code tested, an automated tool like this can't stop them and was never intended to.\r\n\r\nOSS-Fuzz could not find the backdoor and never would have even if this patch was not accepted. The patch disabled testing of a feature (ifuncs) due to an actual [bug an ASAN when using ifuncs](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/342).\r\nIt is totally normal for developers to disable/change testing due to false positives. If this PR was not accepted the build would have remained broken and OSS-Fuzz would have only tested XZ's code from before the ifuncs change.\r\nBut even if the ifunc code was tested in OSS-Fuzz, the backdoor would not be discoverable because the backdoor was only included in deb or RPM builds of XZ, which OSS-Fuzz has never done.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSS-Fuzz is not impacted by the backdoor, because the backdoor never ran on OSS-Fuzz. In addition, OSS-Fuzz runs code in a sandboxed environment so malicious developers/projects cannot harm OSS-Fuzz.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2:\r\nI wanted to highlight the ~half-dozen reasons why the backdoor would never have been discovered by OSS-Fuzz. It's totally much implausible that it would have been discovered here.\r\n\r\n1. This pull request fixed a build breakage caused by a compiler issue. The compiler issue was never fixed, so without this pull request, OSS-Fuzz would have never fuzzed an XZ version after June.\r\n2. The XZ backdoor only built in the tarballs included in the branch and not in the master branch of the git repo that OSS-Fuzz was cloning.\r\n3. The XZ backdoor was only built when using build options for DEB or RPM packages, OSS-Fuzz was using neither: https://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4#:~:text=Running%20as%20part%20of%20a%20debian%20or%20RPM%20package%20build\r\n(this is analysis is from the person who discovered the backdoor).\r\n4. The XZ backdoor only ran when `argv[0]` was `/usr/sbin/sshd` This would never happen in OSS-Fuzz, only in a real environment https://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4#:~:text=argv%5B0%5D%20needs%20to%20be%20/usr/sbin/sshd\r\n5. Nothing OSS-Fuzz does is secret, all the tests and code to do them are public. This was a well planned attack and if the backdoor was going to be run on OSS-Fuzz (which it was not), it seems unlikely \"Jia Tan\" would have not made sure the tests passed. This is of course, very similar to malware writers will test their malware against antivirus until it is undetectable.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 3:\r\nThis patch fixes an actual false positive in ASAN.\r\nIf you change the old XZ dockerfile to check out the XZ source at the time of this PR, you can see how the fuzzers segfault immediately like all other users of ASAN and ifuncs.\r\nASAN's false positives can still be reproduced in OSS-Fuzz (and possibly other clang-15 builds)\r\n```\r\nvoid crunch1(void) {}\r\nvoid crunch2(void) {}\r\n\r\n__attribute__((__ifunc__(\"resolve_crunch\")))\r\nvoid

They own the code they submit to us, our reviews only mean we verified this is a project maintainer, which unfortunately, \"Jia Tan\" was. \r\nIf they don't want code tested, an automated tool like this can't stop them and was never intended to.\r\n\r\nOSS-Fuzz could not find the backdoor and never would have even if this patch was not accepted. The patch disabled testing of a feature (ifuncs) due to an actual [bug an ASAN when using ifuncs](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/342).\r\nIt is totally normal for developers to disable/change testing due to false positives. If this PR was not accepted the build would have remained broken and OSS-Fuzz would have only tested XZ's code from before the ifuncs change.\r\nBut even if the ifunc code was tested in OSS-Fuzz, the backdoor would not be discoverable because the backdoor was only included in deb or RPM builds of XZ, which OSS-Fuzz has never done.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSS-Fuzz is not impacted by the backdoor, because the backdoor never ran on OSS-Fuzz. In addition, OSS-Fuzz runs code in a sandboxed environment so malicious developers/projects cannot harm OSS-Fuzz.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2:\r\nI wanted to highlight the ~half-dozen reasons why the backdoor would never have been discovered by OSS-Fuzz. It's totally much implausible that it would have been discovered here.\r\n\r\n1. This pull request fixed a build breakage caused by a compiler issue. The compiler issue was never fixed, so without this pull request, OSS-Fuzz would have never fuzzed an XZ version after June.\r\n2. The XZ backdoor only built in the tarballs included in the branch and not in the master branch of the git repo that OSS-Fuzz was cloning.\r\n3. The XZ backdoor was only built when using build options for DEB or RPM packages, OSS-Fuzz was using neither: https://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4#:~:text=Running%20as%20part%20of%20a%20debian%20or%20RPM%20package%20build\r\n(this is analysis is from the person who discovered the backdoor).\r\n4. The XZ backdoor only ran when `argv[0]` was `/usr/sbin/sshd` This would never happen in OSS-Fuzz, only in a real environment https://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4#:~:text=argv%5B0%5D%20needs%20to%20be%20/usr/sbin/sshd\r\n5. Nothing OSS-Fuzz does is secret, all the tests and code to do them are public. This was a well planned attack and if the backdoor was going to be run on OSS-Fuzz (which it was not), it seems unlikely \"Jia Tan\" would have not made sure the tests passed. This is of course, very similar to malware writers will test their malware against antivirus until it is undetectable.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 3:\r\nThis patch fixes an actual false positive in ASAN.\r\nIf you change the old XZ dockerfile to check out the XZ source at the time of this PR, you can see how the fuzzers segfault immediately like all other users of ASAN and ifuncs.\r\nASAN's false positives can still be reproduced using this test file in OSS-Fuzz (and possibly other clang-15 builds)\r\n```\r\nvoid crunch1(void) {}\r\nvoid crunch2(void)

They own the code they submit to us, our reviews only mean we verified this is a project maintainer, which unfortunately, \"Jia Tan\" was. \r\nIf they don't want code tested, an automated tool like this can't stop them and was never intended to.\r\n\r\nOSS-Fuzz could not find the backdoor and never would have even if this patch was not accepted. The patch disabled testing of a feature (ifuncs) due to an actual [bug an ASAN when using ifuncs](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/342).\r\nIt is totally normal for developers to disable/change testing due to false positives. If this PR was not accepted the build would have remained broken and OSS-Fuzz would have only tested XZ's code from before the ifuncs change.\r\nBut even if the ifunc code was tested in OSS-Fuzz, the backdoor would not be discoverable because the backdoor was only included in deb or RPM builds of XZ, which OSS-Fuzz has never done.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSS-Fuzz is not impacted by the backdoor, because the backdoor never ran on OSS-Fuzz. In addition, OSS-Fuzz runs code in a sandboxed environment so malicious developers/projects cannot harm OSS-Fuzz.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2:\r\nI wanted to highlight the ~half-dozen reasons why the backdoor would never have been discovered by OSS-Fuzz. It's totally much implausible that it would have been discovered here.\r\n\r\n1. This pull request fixed a build breakage caused by a compiler issue. The compiler issue was never fixed, so without this pull request, OSS-Fuzz would have never fuzzed an XZ version after June.\r\n2. The XZ backdoor only built in the tarballs included in the branch and not in the master branch of the git repo that OSS-Fuzz was cloning.\r\n3. The XZ backdoor was only built when using build options for DEB or RPM packages, OSS-Fuzz was using neither: https://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4#:~:text=Running%20as%20part%20of%20a%20debian%20or%20RPM%20package%20build\r\n(this is analysis is from the person who discovered the backdoor).\r\n4. The XZ backdoor only ran when `argv[0]` was `/usr/sbin/sshd` This would never happen in OSS-Fuzz, only in a real environment https://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4#:~:text=argv%5B0%5D%20needs%20to%20be%20/usr/sbin/sshd\r\n5. Nothing OSS-Fuzz does is secret, all the tests and code to do them are public. This was a well planned attack and if the backdoor was going to be run on OSS-Fuzz (which it was not), it is very likely \"Jia Tan\" would have made sure the tests passed. This is of course, very similar to malware writers will test their malware against antivirus until it is undetectable.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 3:\r\nThis patch fixes an actual false positive in ASAN.\r\nIf you change the old XZ dockerfile to check out the XZ source at the time of this PR, you can see how the fuzzers segfault immediately like all other users of ASAN and ifuncs.\r\nASAN's false positives can still be reproduced using this test file in OSS-Fuzz (and possibly other clang-15 builds)\r\n```\r\nvoid crunch1(void) {}\r\nvoid crunch2(void)

They own the code they submit to us, our reviews only mean we verified this is a project maintainer, which unfortunately, \"Jia Tan\" was. \r\nIf they don't want code tested, an automated tool like this can't stop them and was never intended to.\r\n\r\nOSS-Fuzz could not find the backdoor and never would have even if this patch was not accepted. The patch disabled testing of a feature (ifuncs) due to an actual [bug in ASAN when using ifuncs](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/342).\r\nIt is totally normal for developers to disable/change testing due to false positives. If this PR was not accepted the build would have remained broken and OSS-Fuzz would have only tested XZ's code from before the ifuncs change.\r\nBut even if the ifunc code was tested in OSS-Fuzz, the backdoor would not be discoverable because the backdoor was only included in deb or RPM builds of XZ, which OSS-Fuzz has never done.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSS-Fuzz is not impacted by the backdoor, because the backdoor never ran on OSS-Fuzz. In addition, OSS-Fuzz runs code in a sandboxed environment so malicious developers/projects cannot harm OSS-Fuzz.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2:\r\nI wanted to highlight the ~half-dozen reasons why the backdoor would never have been discovered by OSS-Fuzz. It's totally much implausible that it would have been discovered here.\r\n\r\n1. This pull request fixed a build breakage caused by a compiler issue. The compiler issue was never fixed, so without this pull request, OSS-Fuzz would have never fuzzed an XZ version after June.\r\n2. The XZ backdoor only built in the tarballs included in the branch and not in the master branch of the git repo that OSS-Fuzz was cloning.\r\n3. The XZ backdoor was only built when using build options for DEB or RPM packages, OSS-Fuzz was using neither: https://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4#:~:text=Running%20as%20part%20of%20a%20debian%20or%20RPM%20package%20build\r\n(this is analysis is from the person who discovered the backdoor).\r\n4. The XZ backdoor only ran when `argv[0]` was `/usr/sbin/sshd` This would never happen in OSS-Fuzz, only in a real environment https://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4#:~:text=argv%5B0%5D%20needs%20to%20be%20/usr/sbin/sshd\r\n5. Nothing OSS-Fuzz does is secret, all the tests and code to do them are public. This was a well planned attack and if the backdoor was going to be run on OSS-Fuzz (which it was not), it is very likely \"Jia Tan\" would have made sure the tests passed. This is of course, very similar to malware writers will test their malware against antivirus until it is undetectable.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 3:\r\nThis patch fixes an actual false positive in ASAN.\r\nIf you change the old XZ dockerfile to check out the XZ source at the time of this PR, you can see how the fuzzers segfault immediately like all other users of ASAN and ifuncs.\r\nASAN's false positives can still be reproduced using this test file in OSS-Fuzz (and possibly other clang-15 builds)\r\n```\r\nvoid crunch1(void) {}\r\nvoid crunch2(void)

They own the code they submit to us, our reviews only mean we verified this is a project maintainer, which unfortunately, \"Jia Tan\" was. \r\nIf they don't want code tested, an automated tool like this can't stop them and was never intended to.\r\n\r\nOSS-Fuzz could not find the backdoor and never would have even if this patch was not accepted. The patch disabled testing of a feature (ifuncs) due to an actual [bug in ASAN when using ifuncs](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/342).\r\nIt is totally normal for developers to disable/change testing due to false positives. If this PR was not accepted the build would have remained broken and OSS-Fuzz would have only tested XZ's code from before the ifuncs change.\r\nBut even if the ifunc code was tested in OSS-Fuzz, the backdoor would not be discoverable because the backdoor was only included in deb or RPM builds of XZ, which OSS-Fuzz has never done.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSS-Fuzz is not impacted by the backdoor, because the backdoor never ran on OSS-Fuzz. In addition, OSS-Fuzz runs code in a sandboxed environment so malicious developers/projects cannot harm OSS-Fuzz.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2:\r\nI wanted to highlight the ~half-dozen reasons why the backdoor would never have been discovered by OSS-Fuzz. It's totally implausible that it would have been discovered here.\r\n\r\n1. This pull request fixed a build breakage caused by a compiler issue. The compiler issue was never fixed, so without this pull request, OSS-Fuzz would have never fuzzed an XZ version after June.\r\n2. The XZ backdoor only built in the tarballs included in the branch and not in the master branch of the git repo that OSS-Fuzz was cloning.\r\n3. The XZ backdoor was only built when using build options for DEB or RPM packages, OSS-Fuzz was using neither: https://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4#:~:text=Running%20as%20part%20of%20a%20debian%20or%20RPM%20package%20build\r\n(this is analysis is from the person who discovered the backdoor).\r\n4. The XZ backdoor only ran when `argv[0]` was `/usr/sbin/sshd` This would never happen in OSS-Fuzz, only in a real environment https://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4#:~:text=argv%5B0%5D%20needs%20to%20be%20/usr/sbin/sshd\r\n5. Nothing OSS-Fuzz does is secret, all the tests and code to do them are public. This was a well planned attack and if the backdoor was going to be run on OSS-Fuzz (which it was not), it is very likely \"Jia Tan\" would have made sure the tests passed. This is of course, very similar to malware writers will test their malware against antivirus until it is undetectable.\r\n6. OSS-Fuzz does not detect backdoors and it never has detected one. The only argument one could make that it would find the backdoor is if the backdoor had some memory corruption issue (valgrind seemed to report this).\r\n\r\nUPDATE 3:\r\nThis patch fixes an actual false positive in ASAN.\r\nIf you change the old XZ dockerfile to check out the XZ source at the time of this PR, you can see how the fuzzers segfault immediately like all other users of ASAN and ifuncs.\r\nASAN's false positives can still be reproduced using this test file in OSS-Fuzz (and possibly other clang-15 builds)\r\n```\r\nvoid crunch1(void) {}\r\nvoid crunch2(void)
