All JavaScript is\n          removed to simplify license compliance and to reduce the\n          install size.\n\n        - Fixed a minor bug in lzma_str_from_filters() that produced\n          too many filters in the output string instead of reporting\n          an error if the input array had more than four filters. This\n          bug did not affect xz.\n\n    * Build systems:\n\n        - autogen.sh now invokes the doxygen tool via the new wrapper\n          script doxygen/update-doxygen, unless the command line option\n          --no-doxygen is used.\n\n        - Added microlzma_encoder.c and microlzma_decoder.c to the\n          VS project files for Windows and to the CMake build. These\n          should have been included in 5.3.2alpha.\n\n    * Tests:\n\n        - Added a test to the CMake build that was forgotten in the\n          previous release.\n\n        - Added and refactored a few tests.\n\n    * Translations:\n\n        - Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation.\n\n        - Added Brazilian Portuguese man page translation.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nðŸ“… **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\nðŸš¦ **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\nâ™» **Rebasing**: Whenever PR becomes conflicted, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\nðŸ”• **Ignore**: Close this PR and you won't be reminded about this update again.\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n\n---\n\nThis PR has been generated by [Mend Renovate](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/).
