A lot of such review was interactively done over Signal or\nIRC (that is, text-based chat). Code was pushed to a development branch\non GH and, after a few rounds of feedback and force-pushes to the same\nbranch, it was merged to master.\n\nSome of the test program commits (tests/*.c, tests/*.sh) I didn't\nreview thoroughly back in the day. The files under \".github\" I didn't\nreview at all; I haven't studied how the CI stuff works. My\nunderstanding was and is that those files won't affect anything else in\nthe Git repository or release packages.\n\nIn 2024 I felt that Jia was finally competent enough to not require so\nmuch oversight (with 5.4.x releases I did release tarball comparisons\nas Jia had some trouble getting them right at first). The malicious\ntest files (tests/files/*) all came in 2024. The five odd test files\nwere added right before 5.6.0 release when I wasn't home. 5.6.0 was the\nfirst release I permitted Jia to do alone. I was supposed to focus on\nXZ for Java after XZ Utils 5.6.0.\n\nI'm a chat person. Mailing lists and GH posts take more time to achieve\nthe same thing, that is, chat is more efficient to me.\n\nI plan to explain more about the story later. The priority right now is\nto review the Git repository with the mindset \"is there anything\nmalicious hiding\". That is a natural thing to do when reviewing patches\nfrom random contributors but patches from an active co-maintainer don't\nget the \"is this intentionally malicious\" treatment after a while. Or\nperhaps I'm weird and others remaing suspicious of their co-maintainers\neven after two years of co-operation (even if the personal relationship\nisn't the best).\n\nAnyway, the misinformed complaints how Jia supposedly had a free hand\nin the repository aren't helping the project. Yes, in 2024 he had a lot\nmore freedom but 2023 wasn't like that. Yes, many things could have\nbeen done and could still be done better but lots of advice tend to\nappear a little late; I'm sure that only a few months earlier, many\nwere happy how much Jia had been helping to make the project progress.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2074783322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-24T12:02:39Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
