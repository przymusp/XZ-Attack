The `liblzma` part of XZ is also public domain. There are more pairs of eyes on that code base, because every Linux distribution uses it. There's also real source control with commit messages.\r\n\r\nIn your boost dependency, there already is an iostream filter for `lzma` that works through `liblzma`. I have no idea what your boost version is, but boost 1.83.0 evidently can use multithreaded lzma in its implementation ([source code](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_83_0/libs/iostreams/src/lzma.cpp)). Having lzma iostream is a *really* good idea, because it compresses usually better than bzip2 and decompresses usually faster. bzip2 should really not be a thing in the compress-once-then-distribute-widely use case now that lzma exists.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CauldronDevelopmentLLC/cbang/issues/comments/1990322051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-12T04:35:19Z","org":{"id":6903456,"login":"CauldronDevelopmentLLC","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/CauldronDevelopmentLLC","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6903456?"}}
