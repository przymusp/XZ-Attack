If you have experience working with MSVC that is great.\r\n\r\nI imagine this would require writing a Windows PowerShell or Batch script to do things similar to what ci_build.sh does, and then refactoring windows-ci.yml to utilize the script. We need to use CMake to generate Windows Visual Studio files (using CMake's `-G` option to select the generator) and then compile everything and run the tests from Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt.\r\n\r\nRecently we ported the xz command line tool to work with MSVC so making sure we can continue to build on MSVC as the codebase changes is certianly valuable.
