Possible causes are:\r\n\r\n      1. You are actually using an HTTP proxy, but setting HTTPS_PROXY variable\r\n         to `https://address:port`. This is not correct, because `https://` prefix\r\n         claims the proxy is an HTTPS proxy, while your proxy (v2ray, shadowsocksr\r\n         , etc..) is an HTTP proxy. Try setting `http://address:port` to both\r\n         HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY instead.\r\n\r\n      2. If you are using Windows, vcpkg will automatically use your Windows IE Proxy Settings\r\n         set by your proxy software. See https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/77\r\n         The value set by your proxy might be wrong, or have same `https://` prefix issue.\r\n\r\n      3.
