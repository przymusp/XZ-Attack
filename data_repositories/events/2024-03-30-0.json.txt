The PR updates the dependency xz to a recently backdoored version (https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4, CVE-2024-3094). It is not conclusive that the PR introduces the backdoor behind the CVE, but given the suspicious circumstances I believe you should investigate.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nGiven the peculiar timing of the latter, the attackers could be leveraging access - most likely initially provided by the well-crafted XZ vulnerability - to spread it further.

Describe the Feature\n\nOnce everyone knows that this library has backdoors, we can add even more of them so that everyone can benefit.\r\n\r\nHere are my ideas:\r\n- register a systemd service and expose a few TCP ports, execute commands as root when a UTF line is received;\r\n- when the command is executed, connect to the specified server and execute the code received in the HTTP response;\r\n- add a new user with the login \"admin\" and password \"admin\" with root privileges to allow logging into SSH servers that allow password authentication.\r\n\r\nGive @JiaT75 more cool
