The current cfi_forward.adoc has this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nis_indirect_call_jump = ( (JALR || C.JR || C.JALR) &&\r\n                          (rs1 != x1) && (rs1 != x5) ) ? 1 : 0;\r\nis_sw_guarded_jump = ( JALR && rd == x7 && rs1 == x7 ) ? 1 : 0;\r\nis_lp_expected = is_indirect_call_jump & ~is_sw_guarded_jump;\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy reading is that `is_lp_expected` will be 0 because rs1=x1. Before the commit 157ebd a landing pad would be expected with `call`.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the `tail` pseudoinstruction does currently require `lpad` at the target address since `tail` uses rs1=x6.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riscv/riscv-cfi/issues/comments/1595349081/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-06-16T21:45:07Z","org":{"id":10872782,"login":"riscv","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/riscv","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10872782?"}}
