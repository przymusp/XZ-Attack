Here is an example program that should trigger the warning:\r\n\r\n```C\r\nstatic void resolved(void) {\r\n    return;\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic void (*resolver (void)) (void) {\r\n\treturn resolved;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid indirect_function(void) __attribute__((__ifunc__(\"resolver\")));\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    indirect_function();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nGCC does not issue a warning for the above program. [Here](https://godbolt.org/z/9f1TnjG7h) is a godbolt.org snippet of the above code to allow you to easily test it.

Just curious, is it possible the issue would have been found by a sanitizer were it not for this PR? I don't have an understanding of the backdoor yet.\r\n\r\nThe backdoor is part of a test file. It is a precompiled binary object that is being linked into the binary if it was built from the published tarball rather than git  and only if a large number of specific conditions are passing. The conditions were amongst other things checking whether it's a debian or rpm package build. A plain build will not activate the backdoor.\r\n\r\nWhile turning off ifunc is another way to protect the exploit from unpacking, in the backdoors current form it would not be necessary. Maybe it was necessary in a previous version of the backdoor that wasn't actually committed.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/oss-fuzz/issues/comments/2027675001/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-29T19:51:02Z","org":{"id":1342004,"login":"google","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/google","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1342004?"}}

But the cat is out of the bag now and I see comments all over the place pinging the author. I think it's high time a bug report *here* notifies people following this tracker there is an issue.
