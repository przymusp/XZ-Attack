When `lzma_options_lzma *` is used, it will cause an error.\r\n\r\nThe solution to this can be done either in code or in documentation. The code change would be simple to check if the needed match finders were configured.\r\n\r\nInstead, a documentation change in lzma12.h could make it clear that the preset is valid, but might not work depending on the liblzma configuration (in this case, which match finders were built).\n\n### Version\n\n5.5.0alpha\n\n### Operating System\n\nN/A\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/37/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/37/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-01T13:42:34Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
