The first replaces the crc64 construct with the ifunc resolver.\r\n2. The second modifies the build process to account for the ifunc attribute.\r\n\r\nHAVE_FUNC_ATTRIBUTE_IFUNC is set if ifuncs can be built\r\non the system. glibc has supported ifunc since version 2.11 (2009). Building for older machines\r\nmay want to manually disable ifunc support when building.\r\n--disable-ifunc can be used with autotools and\r\nUSE_ATTR_IFUNC=OFF can be used with CMake to disable the check for ifunc support.\r\nUSE_ATTR_IFUNC defaults to ON for CMake and enable_ifunc defaults to yes for autotools.\r\n\r\nMore about ifuncs can be read [here](https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/GNU_IFUNC) or [here](https://www.agner.org/optimize/optimizing_cpp.pdf#page=142).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been reviewed and added / updated if needed (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Build was run locally and without warnings or errors\r\n- [X] All previous and new tests pass\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request type\r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, renaming, typo fix)\r\n- [X] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [X] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other (please describe): \r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\ncrc64\\_fast currently uses the \\_\\_attribute\\_\\_ constructor to choose the crc implementation to use.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nI replaced the \\_\\_attribute\\_\\_((\\_\\_constructor\\_\\_)) with \\_\\_attribute\\_\\_((ifunc())) in crc64_fast.c\r\n\r\n- The HAVE_FUNC_ATTRIBUTE_IFUNC flag was added to configure.ac\r\n- The USE_ATTR_IFUNC cmake option was added to CMakeLists.txt\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\nFunctionality should be identical.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR.

The first replaces the crc64 construct with the ifunc resolver.\r\n2. The second modifies the build process to account for the ifunc attribute.\r\n\r\nHAVE_FUNC_ATTRIBUTE_IFUNC is set if ifuncs can be built\r\non the system. glibc has supported ifunc since version 2.11 (2009). Building for older machines\r\nmay want to manually disable ifunc support when building.\r\n--disable-ifunc can be used with autotools and\r\nUSE_ATTR_IFUNC=OFF can be used with CMake to disable the check for ifunc support.\r\nUSE_ATTR_IFUNC defaults to ON for CMake and enable_ifunc defaults to yes for autotools.\r\n\r\nMore about ifuncs can be read [here](https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/GNU_IFUNC) or [here](https://www.agner.org/optimize/optimizing_cpp.pdf#page=142).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been reviewed and added / updated if needed (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Build was run locally and without warnings or errors\r\n- [X] All previous and new tests pass\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request type\r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, renaming, typo fix)\r\n- [X] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [X] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] Other (please describe): \r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\ncrc64\\_fast currently uses the \\_\\_attribute\\_\\_ constructor to choose the crc implementation to use.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nI replaced the \\_\\_attribute\\_\\_((\\_\\_constructor\\_\\_)) with \\_\\_attribute\\_\\_((ifunc())) in crc64_fast.c\r\n\r\n- The HAVE_FUNC_ATTRIBUTE_IFUNC flag was added to configure.ac\r\n- The USE_ATTR_IFUNC cmake option was added to CMakeLists.txt\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X]

The first replaces the crc64 construct with the ifunc resolver.\r\n2. The second modifies the build process to account for the ifunc attribute.\r\n\r\nHAVE_FUNC_ATTRIBUTE_IFUNC is set if ifuncs can be built\r\non the system. glibc has supported ifunc since version 2.11 (2009). Building for older machines\r\nmay want to manually disable ifunc support when building.\r\n--disable-ifunc can be used with autotools and\r\nUSE_ATTR_IFUNC=OFF can be used with CMake to disable the check for ifunc support.\r\nUSE_ATTR_IFUNC defaults to ON for CMake and enable_ifunc defaults to yes for autotools.\r\n\r\nMore about ifuncs can be read

The first replaces the crc64 construct with the ifunc resolver.\r\n2. The second modifies the build process to account for the ifunc attribute.\r\n\r\nHAVE_FUNC_ATTRIBUTE_IFUNC is set if ifuncs can be built\r\non the system. glibc has supported ifunc since version 2.11 (2009). Building for older machines\r\nmay want to manually disable ifunc support when building.\r\n--disable-ifunc can be used with autotools and\r\nUSE_ATTR_IFUNC=OFF can be used with CMake to disable the check for ifunc support.\r\nUSE_ATTR_IFUNC defaults to ON for CMake and enable_ifunc defaults to yes for autotools.\r\n\r\nMore about ifuncs can be read

The first replaces the crc64 construct with the ifunc resolver.\r\n2. The second modifies the build process to account for the ifunc attribute.\r\n\r\nHAVE_FUNC_ATTRIBUTE_IFUNC is set if ifuncs can be built\r\non the system. glibc has supported ifunc since version 2.11 (2009). Building for older machines\r\nmay want to manually disable ifunc support when building.\r\n--disable-ifunc can be used with autotools and\r\nUSE_ATTR_IFUNC=OFF can be used with CMake to disable the check for ifunc support.\r\nUSE_ATTR_IFUNC defaults to ON for CMake and enable_ifunc defaults to yes for autotools.\r\n\r\nMore about ifuncs can be read
