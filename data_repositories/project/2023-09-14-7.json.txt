libraries/daemons, if so please check for any security implications. I'm not doing a private report since it is already public on gentoo bugzilla.\r\nIf I can do further, please let me know.\n\n### Version\n\n5.4.4\n\n### Operating System\n\nGentoo\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/62/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/62/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-14T07:48:05Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
