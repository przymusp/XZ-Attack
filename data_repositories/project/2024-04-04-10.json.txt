I mean it could be changed to the real upstream if github is not re-enabling the repo which it should have done at this point at least in archive/read-only mode.\r\n> \r\n\r\nI browsed through all discussions yesterday and found some report the [git.tukaani.org](https://git.tukaani.org/) repository had bandwidth issues. Where we obtain the file from, for now, isn't really relevant, as the hash verifies the authenticity of the file, while the bmirror github account was the proposed one on the other thread.  \r\n\r\n> What are the security folks doing to unblock vcpkg users without an asset cache?\r\n\r\nAsset caches are not supposed to be a reliable source of data. If unused for a \"while\" (which varies between CIs and repository configurations) the asset cache contents will perish silently, if overstressed, the contents might perish, too. Caches usually aren't backup-ed, either, as their contents represent re-fetch-able data. Therefore, if a project is moved, or the CI is redeployed, the asset cache will be gone.\r\n\r\nIt's just a matter of time until asset cached liblzma tarballs drop out of the cache.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/comments/2036807970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-04T10:36:04Z","org":{"id":6154722,"login":"microsoft","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/microsoft","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?"}}
