As a user, would you rather see the number of threads actually used in verbose mode (`-v`) or debug mode (`-vv`)? We are all in agreement that this message should not be displayed by default :)\r\n\r\nAs a user I would not like to see that by default, but in verbose mode or debug mode. But it is a matter of fact that putting that in verbose/debug mode means that a lot of users won't discover that, and then not increase the memory limit if they need it.\r\n\r\nSo for me is fine as-is.\r\n\r\nI opened the issue because in my opinion the required memory is too high. But given the numbers given by @Larhzu I think there is no issue on my side, but since other users may open a ticket for that I'd suggest to put a link or an explanation about why the provided memory limit is not enough. That would avoid a lot of tickets here, I think.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1968455520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-28T08:21:40Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
