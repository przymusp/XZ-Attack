That's more depending on what Windows APIs you have used. If say no Windows 10 or later only APIs is used, the binaries could likely work on Windows 8 or before. That's what _WIN32_WINNT can help. Define _WIN32_WINNT to the minimum Windows version you want to support, whatever version Windows SDK you use should expose only APIs available for that targeted Windows version.\r\nBut I think requiring a specific Windows SDK could be annoying for users only having older VS. There could be reasons that newer version of Windows SDK cannot be installed.\r\nIf I am correct, the current cmake build would just use the latest Windows SDK available and that is handy. Especially if you limit _WIN32_WINNT to say Windows 8, that means any Windows 10 SDK should work.\r\nI have not tried though, cmake might have intelligence to sort things out when you require C11/C17. cmake could just complain if the required SDK does not exist.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/1721895849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-15T21:46:28Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
