If you are using Windows, vcpkg will automatically use your Windows IE Proxy Settings\r\n         set by your proxy software. See https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/77\r\n         The value set by your proxy might be wrong, or have same `https://` prefix issue.\r\n      \r\n      3.

If you are using Windows, vcpkg will automatically use your Windows IE Proxy Settings\r\n         set by your proxy software. See https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/77\r\n         The value set by your proxy might be wrong, or have same `https://` prefix issue.\r\n      \r\n      3.
