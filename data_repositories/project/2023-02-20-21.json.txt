Microblaze builds will fail when trying to add symver information because  `__attribute__((symver ..))` is not supported even though `__has_attribute(__symver__)` returns true.\r\n\r\nSupport for symver needs to be detected via a compile test since `__has_attribute` can report false positives [0].\r\n\r\nAdd a configure compile check for `__attribute__((symver ..))` to ensure it is supported
