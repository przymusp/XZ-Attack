It must have something to do with the `_WIN32_WINNT 0x0600` in `mythread.h`. Either way, the proper include was missing, so thank you for addressing this.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, <intrin.h> also includes <immintrin.h>, so including both is redundant. Instead, these can be combined into something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#if defined(TUKLIB_FAST_UNALIGNED_ACCESS) \\\r\n\t\t&& (defined(__INTEL_COMPILER) && defined(_M_X64)) \\\r\n\t\t\t|| (defined(_MSC_VER) && defined(_M_X64)))\r\n#        define <intrin.h>\r\n#else if HAVE_IMMINTRIN_H\r\n#        define <immintrin.h>\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, please include this as a separate commit from the CI changes.

Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [X] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been reviewed and added / updated if needed (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Build was run locally and without warnings or errors\r\n- [X] All previous and new tests pass\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull request type\r\n\r\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type, submit multiple\r\npull requests if needed. --> \r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, renaming, typo fix)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [X] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content

changes that are being added by this\r\nPR. -->\r\n\r\n- autotools build set for Windows added\r\n- build is using msys2 with UCRT64 toolchain\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n-

Any other information that is important to this PR. -->\r\nCMake build part is not provided as part of this PR.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes:\r\n* bumped checkout action to v3 (not really critical, but I did while trying to understand build failure)\r\n* fixed \"false positive\" uninitialized warning with empty in stream_encoder.c\r\n* fixed missing include in memcmplen.h, because this include is not provided if --disable-threads is requested for build\r\n\r\nWindows build run is very slow (comparing to others), but I don't think it could be somehow improved.","created_at":"2023-02-12T22:06:00Z","updated_at":"2023-02-13T13:57:54Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1804309c9742c51c2952ca25443f4f3088e0b4d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/34/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/34/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/34/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/statuses/e84967a34eb5065e010bafe56042a7de648a2edf","head":{"label":"arixmkii:win-ci","ref":"win-ci","sha":"e84967a34eb5065e010bafe56042a7de648a2edf","user":{"login":"arixmkii","id":36887373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODg3Mzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36887373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii","html_url":"https://github.com/arixmkii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":600817918,"node_id":"R_kgDOI8_A_g","name":"xz","full_name":"arixmkii/xz","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arixmkii","id":36887373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODg3Mzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36887373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii","html_url":"https://github.com/arixmkii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arixmkii/xz","description":"XZ

type\r\n\r\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type, submit multiple\r\npull requests if needed. --> \r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ]

Any other information that is important to this PR. -->\r\nCMake build part is not provided as part of this PR.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes:\r\n* bumped checkout action to v3 (not really critical, but I did while trying to understand build failure)\r\n* fixed \"false positive\" uninitialized warning with empty in stream_encoder.c\r\n* fixed missing include in memcmplen.h, because this include is not provided if --disable-threads is requested for build\r\n\r\nWindows build run is very slow (comparing to others), but I don't think it could be somehow improved.","created_at":"2023-02-12T22:06:00Z","updated_at":"2023-02-13T13:57:54Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1804309c9742c51c2952ca25443f4f3088e0b4d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/34/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/34/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/34/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/statuses/e84967a34eb5065e010bafe56042a7de648a2edf","head":{"label":"arixmkii:win-ci","ref":"win-ci","sha":"e84967a34eb5065e010bafe56042a7de648a2edf","user":{"login":"arixmkii","id":36887373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODg3Mzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36887373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii","html_url":"https://github.com/arixmkii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":600817918,"node_id":"R_kgDOI8_A_g","name":"xz","full_name":"arixmkii/xz","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arixmkii","id":36887373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODg3Mzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36887373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii","html_url":"https://github.com/arixmkii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arixmkii/xz","description":"XZ

Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [X] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been reviewed

type\r\n\r\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type, submit multiple\r\npull requests if needed. --> \r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, renaming, typo fix)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [X] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content

changes that are being added by this\r\nPR. -->\r\n\r\n- autotools build set for Windows added\r\n- build is using msys2 with UCRT64 toolchain\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n-

Any other information that is important to this PR. -->\r\nCMake build part is not provided as part of this PR.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes:\r\n* bumped checkout action to v3 (not really critical, but I did while trying to understand build failure)\r\n* fixed \"false positive\" uninitialized warning with empty in stream_encoder.c\r\n* fixed missing include in memcmplen.h, because this include is not provided if --disable-threads is requested for build\r\n\r\nWindows build run is very slow (comparing to others), but I don't think it could be somehow improved.","created_at":"2023-02-12T22:06:00Z","updated_at":"2023-02-13T13:57:54Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1804309c9742c51c2952ca25443f4f3088e0b4d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/34/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/34/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/34/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/statuses/e84967a34eb5065e010bafe56042a7de648a2edf","head":{"label":"arixmkii:win-ci","ref":"win-ci","sha":"e84967a34eb5065e010bafe56042a7de648a2edf","user":{"login":"arixmkii","id":36887373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODg3Mzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36887373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii","html_url":"https://github.com/arixmkii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":600817918,"node_id":"R_kgDOI8_A_g","name":"xz","full_name":"arixmkii/xz","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arixmkii","id":36887373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODg3Mzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36887373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii","html_url":"https://github.com/arixmkii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arixmkii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arixmkii/xz","description":"XZ

Pull request checklist\r\n\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n- [X] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [X] Docs have been reviewed

type\r\n\r\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type, submit multiple\r\npull requests if needed. --> \r\n\r\nPlease check the type of change your PR introduces:\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, renaming, typo fix)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [X] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content

changes that are being added by this\r\nPR. -->\r\n\r\n- autotools build set for Windows added\r\n- build is using msys2 with UCRT64 toolchain\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n-

Any other information that is important to this PR. -->\r\nCMake build part is not provided as part of this PR.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes:\r\n* bumped checkout action to v3 (not really critical, but I did while trying to understand build failure)\r\n* fixed \"false positive\" uninitialized warning with empty in stream_encoder.c\r\n* fixed missing include in memcmplen.h, because this include is not provided if --disable-threads is requested for build\r\n\r\nWindows build run is very slow (comparing to others), but I don't think it could be somehow
