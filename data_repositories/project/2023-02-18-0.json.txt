Avoiding the traditional method is\ngood because it breaks LTO (-flto) builds with GCC.\n\nSee also: https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=101766\n\nFor now the only extra symbols in liblzma_linux.map are the\ncompatibility symbols with the patch that spread from RHEL/CentOS 7.\nThese require the use of __symver__ attribute or __asm__(\".symver ...\")\nin the C code. Compatibility with the patch from CentOS 7 doesn't\nseem valuable on MicroBlaze so use liblzma_generic.map on MicroBlaze\ninstead. It doesn't require anything special in the C code and thus\nno LTO issues either.\n\nAn alternative would be to detect support for __symver__\nattribute in configure.ac and CMakeLists.txt and fall back\nto __asm__(\".symver ...\") but then LTO would be silently broken\non MicroBlaze. It sounds likely that MicroBlaze is a special\ncase so let's treat it as a such because that is simpler. If\na similar issue exists on some other platform too then hopefully\nsomeone will report it and this can be reconsidered.\n\n(This doesn't do the same fix in CMakeLists.txt. Perhaps it should\nbut perhaps CMake build of liblzma doesn't matter much on MicroBlaze.\nThe problem breaks the build so it's easy to notice and can be fixed\nlater.)\n\nThanks to Vincent Fazio for reporting the problem and proposing\na patch (in the end that solution wasn't used):\nhttps://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/32","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sailfishos-mirror/xz/commits/2ee86d20e49985b903b78ebcfa3fa672e73e93aa"},{"sha":"b9f171dd00a3cc32b6d41ea8e082cf545640ec2a","author":{"email":"lasse.collin@tukaani.org","name":"Lasse Collin"},"message":"Update THANKS.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sailfishos-mirror/xz/commits/b9f171dd00a3cc32b6d41ea8e082cf545640ec2a"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-18T00:20:57Z","org":{"id":62875150,"login":"sailfishos-mirror","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/sailfishos-mirror","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62875150?"}}
