If they don't want code tested, an automated tool like this can't stop them and was never intended to.\r\n\r\nOSS-Fuzz did not find the backdoor and never would have even if this patch was not accepted. The patch disabled testing of a feature (ifuncs) due to a claimed [false positive when testing that feature](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/342). The feature was used in the backdoor, so the developer probably disabled testing so that people would not investigate the feature. \r\nIt is totally normal for developers to disable/change testing due to false positives.\r\n\r\nFinally, OSS-Fuzz is not impacted by the backdoor, because the backdoor never ran on OSS-Fuzz. In addition, OSS-Fuzz runs code in a sandboxed environment so malicious developers/projects cannot harm OSS-Fuzz.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2:\r\nThis patch fixes an actual false positive in ASAN.\r\nThis can
