been preparing a few unrelated changes and including this Delta filter improvement among those. I hope the changes get to master tomorrow. (This is a special case and not the normal way in the project. Sorry.)\r\n\r\nI benchmarked the Delta filter changes. Encoding time was reduced by 60-70 % when distance=1 and over 50 % with long distances. That makes sense as with longer distances more bytes go via the history buffer.\r\n\r\nDecoding time reduced up to 50 % with long distances but only 5 % with distance=1. It's still a clear improvement. I suppose short distance is slower because `buf[off + i] += buf[off + i - distance];` has dependency on the previous iteration; it cannot parallelize like with longer distances.\r\n\r\nI wonder if JVM is smart enough to vectorize the decoder loops when distance is large enough and appropriate multiple of a power of two. For example, distance=240 is a little faster than 248.\r\n\r\nIn any case, thanks for the improvement and sorry that it has taken three years to get it included.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz-java/issues/comments/1979470307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-05T19:17:11Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
