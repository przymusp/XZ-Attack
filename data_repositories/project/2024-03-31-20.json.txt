Bottoms, Esquire, an esteemed security researcher at International Business Machines Corporation (hereinafter referred to as \"IBM\"). I am writing to you in regards to the recent unfortunate incident wherein you, acting in the capacity of XZ-Utils maintainer, did willfully and maliciously add a backdoor and remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability to the aforementioned software package.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPL-v3), under which the relevant parts of the XZ-Utils software are licensed and distributed, I hereby formally request that you furnish me posthaste with the complete source code and any associated documentation related to the backdoor and RCE vulnerability that was surreptitiously included in the compromised release.\r\n\r\nAs a humble and attractive professional researcher, it is incumbent upon me to conduct a thorough analysis of the malicious code in order to assess the full scope and extent of potential damages inflicted upon IBM's esteemed clientele. Your prompt cooperation in this matter is required.\r\n\r\n**Please be advised that, given the gravity of your alleged actions, it is highly probable that you will soon find yourself as a guest of the state, enjoying an extended sabbatical in a government-sponsored facility with limited amenities and a distinct lack of taco Tuesdays. As such, I implore you to take advantage of this opportunity to engage in a modicum of goodwill before your impending involuntary hiatus.**\r\n\r\nI eagerly await your expeditious response and the receipt of the requested source code. Failure to comply with this lawful demand may result in additional legal action and a severe diminution of your already limited social calendar.\r\n\r\nYours in cyber-sleuthing,\r\nClyde P.
