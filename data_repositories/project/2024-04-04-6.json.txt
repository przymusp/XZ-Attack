It's trying to pull the xz library from github, but github has shut down the repo that hosts it because of the recent backdoor security issue. It seems like there's a dependency workaround for that, using a different repo (see: https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/37839#issuecomment-2028011285), but that's pretty far upstream for me.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Try to install colmap using vcpkg `vcpkg.exe install colmap[cuda]:x64-windows`\r\n2. See error log below\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nvcpkg would build/install colmap.\r\n\r\n**Logs and messages**\r\nThe relevant piece of the error log:\r\n```\r\nInstalling 1/55 liblzma:x64-windows@5.4.4...\r\nBuilding liblzma:x64-windows@5.4.4...\r\nDownloading https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/archive/v5.4.4.tar.gz\r\n[DEBUG] Trying to hash C:\\Users\\________\\nerfstudio\\vcpkg\\downloads\\tukaani-project-xz-v5.4.4.tar.gz.10640.part\r\n[DEBUG] C:\\Users\\________\\nerfstudio\\vcpkg\\downloads\\tukaani-project-xz-v5.4.4.tar.gz.10640.part has hash f36692335fbc828b884693e5350a3cd50878f2b18d9030e6654d08924c28588299ed7f10809dc651dfa92b96b7223b72408f3fce324b2a29b8dd6827c1e5b064\r\nerror: Failed to download from mirror set\r\nerror: File does not have the expected hash:\r\nurl: https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/archive/v5.4.4.tar.gz\r\n```\r\nThe github site shows the following message, in lieu of the tarball:\r\n```\r\nThis repository has been disabled.\r\n\r\nAccess to this repository has been disabled by GitHub Staff due to a violation of GitHub's terms of service.
