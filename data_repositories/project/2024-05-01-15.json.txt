It sounds similar to `Co-authored-by:`, not sure if exactly identical though.\r\n\r\nIf I edit a commit, I often feel I should mention it because it's possible that I made an error and it would be wrong to silently put such errors to someone else's name. Using co-something-by in this case feels slightly odd if the main work was almost solely by the other person. It's just that it's good to have something in the commit message to indicate that others shouldn't so easily blame the commit author for errors in the commit.\r\n\r\nIt has also been suggested that one could commit the original thing first and then make a new commit to fix it or clean it up. Perhaps it's OK at least if the original commit isn't truly broken. In some cases this makes commit log harder to read though.\r\n\r\nSo the problem, if there is any, is how to be polite to the contributors so that they feel they were welcome.\r\n\r\nYears ago I used to take patches, edit them, thank the author in the commit message (including if it was a patch etc.), and commit it in my name. In GitHub times it seems that to many it's very valuable to get their name as an author in the commit log as that will then show up on GitHub stats.\r\n\r\nWith tiny things it often would be faster for everyone to just create an issue (or send an email) and let maintainer(s) make the change but then the reporter wouldn't get their name in the commit log _in the preferred way_. Thus nowadays I try to commit things so that contributors get their name as a commit author and not merely mentioned in the commit message and in the file `THANKS`.\r\n\r\n# Signed commits and tags\r\n\r\nI recently added my key to GitHub as instructed by someone on IRC. This made the tags signed by me [appear as Verified](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/tags?after=v5.4.2). To my understanding, it would work the same with signed commits.\r\n\r\nMirroring the repository to multiple places is unrelated to the signatures. Storing signatures is a feature of Git.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/issues/comments/2088621989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-01T15:19:45Z","org":{"id":116083088,"login":"tukaani-project","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/tukaani-project","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116083088?"}}
